We previously reported on the role of microRNA (miR)-145 as a tumor-suppressor in human bladder cancer (BC) cells. In this study, we reveal that miR-145 decreases the Warburg effect by silencing KLF4 in BC cells. The expression levels of miR-145 were significantly lower in clinical BC samples and BC cell lines compared to those in normal tissues and HUC cells. Luciferase assay results showed that miR-145 directly bound to 3'UTR of KLF4, which was shown to be overexpressed in the clinical BC samples using Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Remarkable growth inhibition and apoptosis were induced by the ectopic expression of miR-145 or by the gene silencing of KLF4 (siR-KLF4). Also, Warburg effect-related genes such as PTBP1/PKMs were regulated by the transfection of BC cells with miR-145 or siR-KLF4. These results thus indicate that the miR-145/KLF4/PTBP1/PKMs axis is one of the critical pathways that maintain the Warburg effect in BC carcinogenesis. MiR-145 perturbed the Warburg effect by suppressing the KLF4/PTBP1/PKMs pathway in BC cells, resulting in significant cell growth inhibition.""]",['eng'],,

The present study is about 1) replicating the extent to which social-psychological determinants found in earlier cross-sectional studies explain HPV-vaccination intention, and 2) testing whether HPV-vaccination intention, as well as other social-psychological determinants, are good predictors of future HPV-vaccination uptake in a longitudinal design.!##!Methods!#!A random sample of mothers of girls invited for the vaccination in 2015 was drawn from the Dutch vaccination register (Praeventis) (N=36,000) and from three online panels (N=2483). Two months prior to the vaccination of girls, their mothers were requested to complete a web-based questionnaire by letter (Praeventis sample) or by e-mail (panel samples). HPV-vaccination uptake was derived from Praeventis. Backward linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine most dominant predictors of HPV-vaccination intention and uptake, respectively. The total sample used for data analyses consisted of 8062 mothers. Response rates were 18% for the Praeventis sample and 47% for the panel samples.!##!Results!#!HPV-vaccination intention was best explained by attitude, beliefs, subjective norms, habit, and perceived relative effectiveness of the vaccination; they explained 83% of the variance in HPV-vaccination intention. Intention appeared to be the only stable predictor of HPV-vaccination uptake and explained 43% of the variance in HPV-vaccination uptake.!##!Conclusions!#!These results confirm what was found by earlier cross-sectional studies, and provide strong leads for selecting relevant targets in the planning of future communication strategies aiming to improve HPV-vaccination uptake.']",['eng'],,

Despite AAP recommendations to avoid bedsharing, public health efforts have been unsuccessful in changing behaviors. African-American infants are more than twice as likely to die from SIDS and other sleep-related deaths, and are also twice as likely to bedshare with their parents. Further, African-American parents have a high degree of self-efficacy with regards to preventing infant suffocation, but low self-efficacy with regards to SIDS risk reduction. It is unclear whether messages emphasizing suffocation prevention will decrease bedsharing. To evaluate the impact of specific health messages on African-American parental decisions regarding infant sleep location. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of African-American mothers of infants. The control group received standard messaging emphasizing AAP-recommended safe sleep practices, including avoidance of bedsharing, for the purposes of SIDS risk reduction. The intervention group received enhanced messaging emphasizing safe sleep practices, including avoidance of bedsharing, for both SIDS risk reduction and suffocation prevention. Participants completed interviews at 2-3\xa0weeks, 2-3\xa0months, and 5-6\xa0months after the infant's birth. 1194 mothers were enrolled in the study, and 637 completed all interviews.

The questionnaire included questions regarding skill lab use and its benefits to them in developing their skills, with a few questions related to the exam pattern. The responses were expressed in frequencies.!##!Results!#!We found that all (20/20) students performed CPR with confidence and without hesitation on the manikin. The practical examination performance (marks) was categorized as excellent (7/20), good (8/20), average (3/20), and poor (2/20). The pass percentage after skill training was increased by 25% as compared with conventional teaching practice. The majority of the students (17/20) mentioned that skill is better learned by doing than by observing others\' performance or watching videos. A few students (6/20) said skills are better learned by observing the real disease state. They mentioned that skill lab is the better choice for learning major skills such as catheterization, opening vein, auscultation of heart sounds, and endotracheal intubation.!##!Conclusion!#!Students are confident and showed better exam performance after basic clinical skills training in the lab.

This is a retrospective comparative study of patients presented with vaginal mesh exposure between January 2001 and July 2012. This study compares patients who had undergone vaginally placed mesh procedures to those who had had abdominally placed mesh. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to measure the time to mesh exposure. There were 68 patients with mesh exposure in our cohort. Thirty eight patients had undergone vaginal placement of mesh and 30 patients had abdominal mesh. There was a statistically significant difference in time to mesh exposure between abdominal and vaginal meshes (p≤.0001). Mean time to vaginal mesh exposure with abdominal mesh was 59.8 months (95%CI 46.2-73.3) compared to 23 months (95%CI 15.9-30.2) for vaginal mesh. When controlling for age, BMI and surgeon at index surgery, the Hazard Ratio for mesh exposure in our Cox Regression model was 0.53 (95%CI 0.39-0.71) (p\u2009≤.0001). The mean time to vaginal mesh exposure after abdominal mesh was longer compared to the time to exposure with vaginally placed mesh (60 versus 23 months, p\u2009≤.0001). These results support the evolving evidence that mesh exposures can occur many years distant from the procedure and warrant some level of surveillance or provision of warning signs by the providers who perform procedures with mesh.']",['eng'],"['Abdomen/surgery', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Pelvic Floor Disorders/surgery', 'Pelvic Organ Prolapse/surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Suburethral Slings/adverse effects', 'Surgical Mesh/adverse effects', 'Urinary Incontinence/surgery', 'Vagina/surgery']",

The example of breast screening.'],"['""Nudge, or nudging, refers to a policy approach inspired by behavioral sciences: it promotes the conducts identified as desirable by regulators without applying prohibition and coercion. This approach has gained a lot of momentum in the domain of health policies. Policy strategies based on behavioral insights appear ideal as to implementing healthier life styles and public health programs while minimizing compliance costs: from organ donation to food choices, from fighting obesity and chronic diseases to screening policies. Nudging, however, is not exempt from problems, especially in the sector of health, where individual free and informed consent constitutes a founding principle. Cancer screening programs, and especially breast cancer population tests, represent an interesting example for nudging strategies which have been widely applied but have also raised serious criticisms. Despite having been widely adopted by health systems, from the United States to the European Union, breast cancer screening programs keep raising debates about their actual impact on reducing mortality, risks of overdiagnosing and unnecessary or harmful treatments. In challenging the validity of screening programs, these controversies also affect their efficacy. Nudging has therefore been seen as a potentially useful tool in increasing participation, even though the extent of its actual impact remains ambiguous and problematic. For nudging to represent a relevant, powerful policy instrument its legitimacy requirements need to be identified. These concern the ""right place"" of behavioral-based measures within the traditional regulatory framework. The ""right place"" of nudging in science-based policies is part of a broader rethinking of what is democracy in ""knowledge-based societies"", namely through which procedures democratic institutions validate and legitimize their normative choices depending on uncertain and controversial knowledge.""']",['ita'],,

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of maths anxiety on healthcare students' ability to accurately calculate drug dosages by performing a scoping review of the existing literature. This review utilised a six-stage methodology using the following databases; CINAHL, Embase, Medline, Scopus, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, Trip database (http://www.tripdatabase.com/) and Grey Literature report (http://www.greylit.org/). After an initial title/abstract review of relevant papers, and then full text review of the remaining papers, six articles were selected for inclusion in this study. Of the six articles included, there were three experimental studies, two quantitative studies and one mixed method study. All studies addressed nursing students and the presence of maths anxiety. No relevant studies from other disciplines were identified in the existing literature. Three studies took place in the U.S, the remainder in Canada, Australia and United Kingdom. Upon analysis of these studies, four factors including maths anxiety were identified as having an influence on a student's drug dosage calculation abilities. Ultimately, the results from this review suggest more research is required in nursing and other relevant healthcare disciplines regarding the effects of maths anxiety on drug dosage calculations. This additional knowledge will be important to further inform development of strategies to decrease the potentially serious effects of errors in drug dosage calculation to patient safety.

The apparent Km values were 0.125 microM for the 1-hydroxylase and 2.1 microM for the 24-hydroxylase. Exogenous 1,25(OH)2D3 decreased 1-hydroxylase and increased 24-hydroxylase within 4 h. 24,25(OH)2D3 produced similar effects, but only in the absence of fetal calf serum. R and S isomers of 1,24,25(OH)3D3 were about fives times less active than 1,25(OH)2D3. Bovine parathyroid hormone stimulated the 1- and reduced the 24-hydroxylase in 6 h, but this only occurred in cultures either previously treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 and EGTA to lower Ca to 0.8 mM or in cultures grown in the presence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3). Under the latter condition, the sensitivity to bovine parathyroid hormone was enhanced, 0.04 U/ml producing a maximum response. Synthetic aminoterminal tetratriacontapeptide (1-34) human parathyroid hormone was equally effective. In the absence of D metabolites, estradiol for 6 h produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the 1-hydroxylase, but no change in the 24-hydroxylase. Progesterone, testosterone, and corticosterone had no significant effect. In cultures grown in the presence of 25(OH)D3 no reproducible effects were obtained with either 1 microM estradiol or 1 microM testosterone, alone or in combination, but 5 microM corticosterone decreased the 1- and increased the 24-hydroxylase. Changes in Ca and P concentrations of the medium as well as addition of ethane-l-hydroxy-1, 1-diphosphate for 48 h did not affect any of the hydroxylase activities. The modulation of the hydroxylase activities by vitamin D3 metabolites and parathyroid hormone suggests that these factors regulate the renal hydroxylase by direct actions, whereas it would appear that ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-diphosphate, Ca, P, and steroid may exert their influence indirectly.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chickens', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dihydroxycholecalciferols/metabolism', 'Etidronic Acid/pharmacology', 'Hormones/pharmacology', 'Hydroxycholecalciferols/metabolism', 'Kidney/drug effects', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Parathyroid Hormone/pharmacology', 'Phosphorus/pharmacology', 'Steroid Hydroxylases/metabolism', 'Steroids/pharmacology']","['Dihydroxycholecalciferols', 'Hormones', 'Hydroxycholecalciferols', 'Parathyroid Hormone', 'Steroids', 'Phosphorus (27YLU75U4W)', 'Steroid Hydroxylases (EC 1.14.-)', 'Etidronic Acid (M2F465ROXU)', 'Calcium (SY7Q814VUP)']"

(1976). In the following experiment, to pursue the findings further, ursodesoxycholic acid was used curatively for alloxan diabetes. A first group of animals (5 mice) were injected with alloxan (4 mg) twice at the fifth and tenth day. The second group (5 mice) was injected with ursodesoxycholic acid (0.2 mg each) for 14 days during the experiment in addition to the same alloxan dosage/frequency as the first group. A third group of animals (5 mice) served as the control. The animals were sacrificed on the 15th day and the blood sugar levels were examined, using commercial test paper. The pancreatic tissues were fixed in a mixture of 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% osmid acid solution, which was adjusted at pH 7.4 with a veronal acetate buffer; the osmotic pressure was also regulated by adding sucrose of 0.045 g/ml. Following dehydration using a series of alcohol concentrations, the tissues were embedded in Epon 812. Thin sections were cut with a Porter-Blum MT-2B ultramicrotome, stained with both uranyl acetate and a lead mixture, and then observed by electron microscopy. The results were as follows: The pancreatic islet cells, especially of B-cells in the first group of animals injected with alloxan only, were seriously damaged and contained myelinated mitochondria. Golgi apparatus, and an increasing number of autophagic vacuoles. Some B-cells revealed hydropic degeneration. Some B-granules changed into vacuoles after diacrine secretion. Pancreatic A-cells were increased in number and showed no cell injuries. On the other hand, the pancreatic B-cells of mice treated with both alloxan and ursodesoxycholic acid maintained almost normal fine structures. In summary, ursodesoxycholic acid has a curative effect on alloxan-induced pancreatic B-cell injury.']",['jpn'],"['Animals', 'Blood Glucose/analysis', 'Deoxycholic Acid/therapeutic use', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/pathology', 'Golgi Apparatus/ultrastructure', 'Islets of Langerhans/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/ultrastructure']","['Blood Glucose', 'Deoxycholic Acid (005990WHZZ)']"

Four of the five showed a significant improvement in PaO2, a decrease in AaDO2 and Qs/Qt, the fifth a slight improvement on PEEP. Arterial washouts were significantly faster on  PEEP in all patients suggesting a decrease in intrapulmonary shunting. Airway washouts in the initial phase were faster off PEEP suggesting an increase in lung volume and FRC with PEEP.

It was found that neurofibrillary degeneration is present at an earlier age than has been reported for a comparable population in Japan, and much earlier than reported for two similarly comparable English populations. Our data suggests that neurofibrillary degeneration is the common denominator of the Guam neurological syndromes of parkinsonian dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and dementia without parkinsonism. This conclusion would imply that the aetiological factor of neurofibrillary degeneration is more widely dispersed in the population than suggested by the cases of parkinsonian dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis alone. Both sexes were equally affected while clinical parkinsonian dementia is three times more frequent among males. The sample data suggests a positive association with the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-parkinsonian dementia rate in village of birth and residence, and also with family history; the results in the small subsamples are not significant. Senile plaques were found in few control cases in this study, just as there has been a relative absence of senile plaques in cases of parkinsonian dementia. In a small group of Caucasians who had spent many of their adult years on Guam, the frequency of neurofibrillary degeneration in relationship to age was comparable to that in the English populations.']",['eng'],"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alzheimer Disease/epidemiology', 'Alzheimer Disease/pathology', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/pathology', 'Asian Continental Ancestry Group', 'Brain Diseases/epidemiology', 'Brain Diseases/pathology', 'Cerebral Cortex/pathology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Guam', 'Hippocampus/pathology', 'Humans', 'Locus Coeruleus/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neurofibrils/pathology', 'Organ Size', 'Parkinson Disease/pathology', 'Substantia Nigra/pathology']",

Doses of 25(OH)D3 were 20, 100, 500, or 1000 microgram/day given orally for 7--10 days. There was an increase in 47Ca absorption and urinary calcium in normal subjects receiving 20 microgram/day, while doses of 500 or 1000 microgram/day were required to augment 47Ca absorption in renal failure patients. During treatment, plasma levels of 25(OH)D increased to similar levels in both normal and uremic subjects. A comparison of the dose-response curves found 25(OH)D3 to be 1/125 as potent as 1,25-(OH)2D3 in the normal subjects and 1/400 as potent as 1,25(OH)2D3 in patients with chronic renal failure. Thus, pharmacologic doses of 25(OH)D3 are active in both normal and uremic patients, although relatively greater quantities are necessary in uremia. This difference in relative potency of 1,25(OH)2D3 and 25(OH)D3 may be explained by some conversion of 25(OH)D3 to 1,25(OH)2D3 in normal compared to uremic subjects, while 25(OH)D3 may act in large part via mass action in uremic patients.']",['eng'],"['Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium/urine', 'Dihydroxycholecalciferols/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Hydroxycholecalciferols/pharmacology', 'Intestinal Absorption/drug effects', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Uremia/metabolism']","['Dihydroxycholecalciferols', 'Hydroxycholecalciferols', 'Calcium (SY7Q814VUP)']"

Test materials were injected into the cranial thyroid artery of the dog, and immunoreactive PTH was measured frequently in serum samples from the inferior thyroid vein and the femoral vein. This model for the study of secretion had previously been validated with the use of known modulators on PTH secretion. In control experiments, injection of 100% ethanol, the vehicle in which cholecalciferol (D(3)) metabolites were suspended, resulted in no change in PTH secretion. Likewise, native vitamin D(3), in doses ranging from 250 to 1,250 ng had no effect on PTH secretion. 25-Hydroxycholecalciferol, 25-(OH)D(3), in doses of 125-240 ng, caused complete suppression of PTH secretion. When 24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, 24,25-(OH)(2)D(3), was injected in doses of 50-250 ng, suppression of PTH secretion was again complete; in doses of 5 ng, injection of this metabolite resulted in significant but incomplete suppression of secretion. In doses of 50-250 ng, 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) strongly stimulated PTH secretion, but in a dose of 5 ng this metabolite had no effects. Injection of equal doses of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) and 24,25-(OH)(2)D(3) resulted in significant suppression of PTH secretion. Hypocalcemia-induced stimulation of PTH secretion was suppressed by 24,25-(OH)(2)D(3) while hypercalcemia-induced suppression of PTH secretion was stimulated by 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3). In all experiments showing suppression of PTH secretion, peripheral PTH decreased. Arguments are presented for considering the suppressive effects of D(3) metabolites as physiologic modulators. However, this stimulating effect of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) occurred only in pharmacologic doses and hence probably has no physiologic relevance.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Dihydroxycholecalciferols/pharmacology', 'Dogs', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Hydroxycholecalciferols/pharmacology', 'Hypercalcemia/metabolism', 'Hypocalcemia/metabolism', 'Male', 'Parathyroid Hormone/secretion', 'Secretory Rate/drug effects']","['Dihydroxycholecalciferols', 'Hydroxycholecalciferols', 'Parathyroid Hormone']"

Both 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OHD(3)) at a concentration of 20 ng/ml or greater and 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)] at a concentration of 50 pg/ml or greater stimulated the rate of accumulation of [(32)P]phosphate and (45)Ca by the explants and the incorporation of [(3)H]thymidine into DNA. The accumulation of [(32)P]phosphate by the explants was against a concentration gradient and inhibited by ouabain and dinitrophenol. Two saturable mechanisms appeared to mediate the cellular accumulation of phosphate with K(a) of 0.0047 and 0.125 mM, respectively. The V(max) of the lower affinity transport mechanism was accelerated by 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3). Actinomycin D (5.0 mug/ml) did not block the intestinal response to 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) stimulation of both [(32)p]phosphate and (45)Ca accumulation. Significant stimulation of [(32)P]phosphate accumulation was observed 30 min after the addition of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3), preceding the sterol-induced increase in the rate of (45)Ca uptake by 30 min and the sterol-induced increase in [(3)H]thymidine incorporation into DNA by 150 min. Increasing extracellular phosphate concentration to 3.0 mM increased [(3)H]thymidine incorporation into DNA and the rate of (45)Ca uptake by the explants. Reducing extracellular phosphate concentration to 0.05 mM attenuated the response of the explants to 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3). From these observations it is postulated that the primary action of vitamin D sterols in the intestine is to enhance the ability of the mucosal cell to accumulate phosphate. The data suggest that restoration of intracellular phosphate levels may then permit expression of the cells' response to vitamin D sterols.""]",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Chickens', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dihydroxycholecalciferols/pharmacology', 'Dinitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Hydroxycholecalciferols/pharmacology', 'Intestinal Mucosa/drug effects', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism', 'Intestines/drug effects', 'Intestines/metabolism', 'Iodoacetamide/pharmacology', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Ouabain/pharmacology', 'Phosphates/metabolism', 'Phosphates/pharmacology', 'Phosphates/physiology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Vitamin D/pharmacology', 'Vitamin D Deficiency/metabolism', 'Vitamin D Deficiency/physiopathology']","['Dihydroxycholecalciferols', 'Dinitrophenols', 'Hydroxycholecalciferols', 'Phosphates', 'Vitamin D (1406-16-2)', 'Dactinomycin (1CC1JFE158)', 'Ouabain (5ACL011P69)', 'DNA (9007-49-2)', 'Cycloheximide (98600C0908)', 'Thymidine (VC2W18DGKR)', 'Iodoacetamide (ZRH8M27S79)']"

The Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale was used to measure health locus of control. An educational, low-fear intervention, consisting of the presentation of a pictorial diagram of the progression of periodontal disease and discussion of the importance of flossing was presented to the experimental subjects before monitoring began. Control subjects underwent a brief dental examination and flossing instruction only. Self-reported flossing compliance was monitored for 24 days following the dental examination and intervention. Significant decreases in the dental exam variables associated with plaque were found for both the experimental and control conditions. The low-fear, educational intervention had no significant impact on compliance. Instead, a dental exam and self-monitoring were as effective at increasing flossing compliance as the more time-consuming educational approach. A significant increase in internality of health locus of control across all subjects was also found. No significant interaction was found between health locus of control and group, but a trend was apparent. Control subjects who were externally oriented had the lowest flossing compliance scores while internal subjects in both conditions had higher flossing compliance scores.']",['eng'],"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Dental Devices, Home Care/utilization', 'Dental Plaque/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Internal-External Control', 'Male', 'Oral Hygiene/methods', 'Patient Compliance']",

To investigate the interactions of ubiquinone with the cyt bc1 complex, we have examined the distinctive EPR line shapes of the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the cyt bc1 complex when the Qpool-cyt bc1 complex interactions are modulated by changing the numbers of Q or QH2 present (by solvent extraction and reconstitution), by the exposure of the [2Fe-2S] to the Qpool in different redox states, by the presence of inhibitors specific for the Qo site (myxothiazol and stigmatellin) and Qi site (antimycin), and by site-specific mutations of side chains of the cyt b polypeptide (mutants F144L and F144G) previously identified as important for Qo site structure. Evidence suggests that the Qo site can accommodate two ubiquinone molecules. One (designated Qos) is bound relatively strongly and is second only to the ubiquinone of the QA site of the reaction center in its resistance to solvent extraction. In this strong interaction, the Qo site binds Q and QH2 with approximately equal affinities. Their bound states are distinguished by their effects on the [2Fe-2S] cluster spectral feature at gx at 1.783 (Q) and gx at 1.777 (QH2); titration of the line-shape change reveals an Em7 value of approximately 95 mV. The other molecule (Qow) is bound more weakly, in the same range as the ubiquinone of the QB site of the reaction center. Again, the affinities of the Q form (gx at 1.800) and QH2 form (gx at 1.777) are nearly equal, and the Em7 value measured is approximately 80 mV. These results are discussed in terms of earlier EPR analyses of the cyt bc1 complexes of other systems. A Qo site double-occupancy model is considered that builds on the previous model based on Qo site mutants [Robertson, D. E., Daldal, F.,& Dutton, P. L. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 11249-11260] and includes the recent suggestion that two of the [2F3-2S] cluster ligands of the R. capsulatus cyt bc1 complex are histidines [Gurbiel, R. J. Ohnishi, T., Robertson, D. E. Daldal, F., & Hoffman, B. M. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 11579-11584].

Rearrangements principally affect some constitutive heterochromatin and, to a lesser degree, telomeric regions. This results in multiple exchanges between a limited number of chromosome structures, i.e., in jumping translocations. Such rearrangements occur even at early passages and some of them give rise to clonal rearrangements that accumulate at late passages. This process is responsible for progressive modification of the karyotypes, principally characterized by deletion of a number of chromosome segments. Thus, clonal rearrangements are selected among many others not occurring at random. The selective pressure retaining clonal rearrangement seems to be similar for the 4 independent clones, since selection of the derivative chromosomes leads to the same imbalances, whatever the origin of the clone. This sequence of events recalls that of human solid tumors, since jumping rearrangements are generally observed in pre-malignant conditions or in low-grade malignancies, whereas clonal rearrangements leading to typical imbalances are detected in more advanced malignant tumors.']",['eng'],"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Simian virus 40/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",

In the presence of PEG, Rubisco activase exhibited higher ATPase and Rubisco activating activities, concomitant with increased apparent affinity for ATP and Rubisco. Specific ATPase activity, which was dependent on Rubisco activase concentration, was also higher in the presence of Ficoll, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and bovine serum albumin. The ability of Rubisco activase to facilitate dissociation of the tight-binding inhibitor 2-carboxyarabinitol 1-phosphate from carbamylated Rubisco was also enhanced in the presence of PEG. Mixing experiments with Rubisco activase from two different sources showed that tobacco Rubisco activase, which exhibited little activation of spinach Rubisco by itself, was inhibitory when included with spinach Rubisco activase. Polyethylene glycol improved the ability of tobacco and a mixture of tobacco plus spinach Rubisco activase to activate spinach Rubisco. Estimates based on rate zonal sedimentation and gel-filtration chromatography indicated that the apparent molecular mass of Rubisco activase was two- to fourfold higher in the presence of PEG. The increase in apparent molecular mass was consistent with the propensity of solvent-excluding reagents like PEG to promote self-association of proteins. Likewise, the change in enzymatic properties of Rubisco activase in the presence of PEG and the dependence of specific activity on protein concentration resembled changes that often accompany self-association. For Rubisco activase, high concentrations of protein in the chloroplast stroma would provide an environment conducive to self-association and cause expression of properties that would enhance its ability to function efficiently in vivo.']",['eng'],"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Kinetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Weight', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plants/enzymology', 'Plants, Toxic', 'Polyethylene Glycols/pharmacology', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase/isolation & purification', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase/metabolism', 'Species Specificity', 'Tobacco/enzymology']","['Macromolecular Substances', 'Plant Proteins', 'rca protein, plant', 'Polyethylene Glycols (3WJQ0SDW1A)', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases (EC 3.6.1.-)', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.39)']"

The ratio of 19- to 11-hydroxylation was invariant with changes in concentration of substrate or a competitive inhibitor. It is most likely, therefore, that a single 11,19-hydroxylase catalyzes both oxidations. Both primary products are further oxidized to the corresponding carbonyl analogs, 19-oxo-DOC and 11-dehydrocorticosterone, at rates that are approx. 20% of their rates of formation. The oxidation of 11-dehydrocorticosterone is catalyzed by a dehydrogenase utilizing either NAD or NADP while the oxidation of 19-hydroxy-DOC is catalyzed by an oxidase requiring NADPH. The 11-dehydrocorticosterone is stable in this enzyme preparation while 19-oxo-DOC is metabolized to two additional products, which are tentatively identified as 19-oic-DOC and 19-norcorticosterone. 19-nor-DOC was found to be hydroxylated at a rate that is 20% faster than the rate for DOC under the same conditions. It is therefore possible that 19-norcorticosterone can arise from 19-oic-DOC via decarboxylation to 19-nor-DOC and subsequent 11-hydroxylation, but the kinetics of its formation suggest that it may actually be formed directly from 19-oxo-DOC without free intermediates. 4-Androstene-3,17-dione and 17-hydroxy-DOC were also substrates for this 11,19-hydroxylase, but 18-hydroxy-DOC was not.

Recent work suggests that a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent 11 beta-OHSD isoform is expressed in distal renal tubule, in contrast with the hepatic isoform which is NAD(+)-phosphate (NADP+)-dependent. To establish the distribution of the NAD(+)-dependent isoform we measured in vitro conversion of [3H]corticosterone to [3H]11-dehydrocorticosterone in homogenized rat tissues in the presence of NADP+ or NAD+. In most tissues (liver, testis, hippocampus, heart, aorta, mesenteric artery) NADP+ increased activity and NAD+ was without effect. However, in whole renal cortex, colon, placenta, and lung both NADP+ and NAD+ increased activity. No difference in cofactor utilization was demonstrated between proximal and distal renal tubules following density gradient separation. This distribution of NAD(+)-dependent activity corresponds with: (i) the distribution of multiple mRNA and/or protein species of 11 beta-OHSD; (ii) the distribution of aldosterone-specific mineralocorticoid receptors; and (iii) the equilibrium between active and inactive glucocorticoids in each tissue. We suggest that the tissue-specific expression of isoforms of 11 beta-OHSD with different kinetic properties confers on them diverse roles in modulating corticosteroid receptor activation.']",['eng'],"['11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases', 'Animals', 'Colon/enzymology', 'Corticosterone/analogs & derivatives', 'Corticosterone/metabolism', 'Female', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/analysis', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/metabolism', 'Kidney Cortex/enzymology', 'Lung/enzymology', 'NAD/pharmacology', 'NADP/pharmacology', 'Placenta/enzymology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Tissue Distribution']","['NAD (0U46U6E8UK)', 'NADP (53-59-8)', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.-)', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.146)', '11-dehydrocorticosterone (FO4V44A3G3)', 'Corticosterone (W980KJ009P)']"

This could suggest a rising incidence of the disease but is probably largely related to the recently acquired ability to demonstrate minimal and mild lesions. However, estimates of the distribution of endometriosis in the female population might be unreliable due to lack of control of the variables which influence diagnosis of the disease in the initial stages. Analysis of data from prospective studies on asymptomatic women undergoing tubal sterilization reveals a markedly higher than expected frequency of endometriosis. This raises doubts on the clinical significance of the minimal lesions that are often found. The concept that initial endometriosis should always be treated to avoid worsening of the condition seems to lack a convincing rational basis and is not supported by definitive scientific evidence. Minimal/mild endometriosis could represent a temporary phase in an on-going process that usually results in cytolysis of recently implanted endometrial cells, whereas in a few immunologically 'tolerant' subjects, nodular, cystic and infiltrating lesions develop, with eventual progression to moderate and severe stages.""]",['eng'],"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Endometriosis/diagnosis', 'Endometriosis/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies']",

M1660429,['Direct cloning of a long restriction fragment aided with a jumping clone.'],"[""Long-range physical mapping with rare-cutting restriction enzymes (rare cutters) is an important step for structural analysis of complex genomes. Combination of two types of DNA clones bearing the rare-cutter sites, linking clones and jumping clones (Fig. 1a), facilitates the physical mapping [Poustka et al., Nature 325 (1987) 353-355]. A step followed by the physical mapping is the cloning of the large (rare-cutter-generated) restriction fragment of interest. For facilitating this step, we devised a method to directly clone a long restriction fragment without constructing the whole genomic DNA library using the jumping clone as starting material. The short DNA segments of a jumping clone, which are derived from the 5' and 3' terminal regions of the large restriction fragment, are inserted into the yeast artificial chromosome plasmid (pYAC) vector, and then converted into single strands with T7 gene 6-encoded 5'----3' exonuclease. The total genomic DNA digested with the restriction enzyme is also treated with the exonuclease to convert the terminal regions of the restriction fragments into single strands. In the resulting products, only the fragment corresponding to the jumping clone can form hybrids with the just-mentioned, single-stranded DNAs, which are connected to the pYAC, and only this fragment is cloned in yeast.

The larger the proportion of native (or near-native) speakers included in a set of sentences being evaluated, the more strongly accented listeners judged sentences spoken by non-native speakers to be. Foreign accent ratings were not stable. Listeners judged a set of non-native-produced sentences to be more strongly accented after, as compared to before, they became familiar with those sentences. One talker-related effect noted in the study was the finding that adults' pronunciation of an L2 may improve over time. Late L2 learners who had lived in the United States for an average of 14.3 years received significantly higher scores than late learners who had resided in the United States for 0.7 years. Another talker-related effect pertained to the age of L2 learning (AOL). Native Spanish subjects with an AOL of five to six years were not found to have an accent (i.e., to receive significantly lower scores than native English speakers), whereas native Chinese subjects with an average AOL of 7.6 years did have a measurable accent.

M1783374,['New strategy for mapping the human genome based on a novel procedure for construction of jumping libraries.'],"['A novel procedure for construction of jumping libraries is described. The essential features of this procedure are as follows: (1) two diphasmid vectors (lambda SK17 and lambda SK22) are simultaneously used in the library construction to improve representativity, (2) a partial filling-in reaction is used to eliminate cloning of artifactual jumping clones and to obviate the need for a selectable marker. The procedure has been used to construct a representative human NotI jumping library (220,000 independent recombinant clones) from the lymphoblastoid cell line CBMI-Ral-STO, which features a low level of methylation of its resident EBV genomes. A human chromosome 3-specific NotI jumping library (500,000 independent recombinant clones) from the human chromosome 3 x mouse hybrid cell line MCH 903.1 has also been constructed. Of these recombinant clones 50-80% represent jumps to the neighboring cleavable NotI site. With our previously published method for construction of linking libraries this procedure makes a new genome mapping strategy feasible. This strategy includes the determination of tagging sequences adjacent to NotI sites in random linking and jumping clones. Special features of the lambda SK17 and lambda SK22 vectors facilitate such sequencing. The STS (sequence tagged site) information obtained can be assembled by computer into a map representing the linear order of the NotI sites for a chromosome or for the entire genome. The computerized mapping data can be used to retrieve clones near a region of interest. The corresponding clones can be obtained from the panel of original clones, or necessary probes can be made from genomic DNA by PCR.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping/methods', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Gene Library', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']","['Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific (EC 3.1.21.4)', 'GCGGCCGC-specific type II deoxyribonucleases (EC 3.1.21.4)']"

We prospectively determined the minimum effective dose of bedtime UDCA in 44 patients with radiolucent gallstones treated with a range of UDCA doses (4.6-17.0 mg/kg/day). The average minimum effective dose for reducing the cholesterol saturation index (SI) of gallbladder bile to a value of 0.8 was 8.4 mg/kg/day for bedtime UDCA. The greater potency of the bedtime regimen was confirmed in seven individual patients by comparison with a mealtime regimen. Cholesterol SI was reduced from 1.25 during placebo to 0.73 during 7 mg/kg/day for bedtime UDCA and to 0.81 during 10 mg/kg/day for mealtime UDCA. The effect of the bedtime regimen was not enhanced by a repeated-release tablet formulation of UDCA by comparison with UDCA in 15 patients. We conclude that the bile acid dose is reduced during bedtime UDCA administration by comparison with mealtime UDCA in individual patients and that the best-buy regimen is 8.4 mg/kg/day UDCA given at bedtime for patients with gallstones as a group. With this dose, gallstone dissolution can be supported by unsaturated gallbladder bile at minimum risk of dose-related side effects and at minimum treatment costs.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bile/chemistry', 'Cholelithiasis/drug therapy', 'Cholelithiasis/economics', 'Cholesterol/analysis', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Time Factors', 'Ursodeoxycholic Acid/administration & dosage', 'Ursodeoxycholic Acid/therapeutic use']","['Ursodeoxycholic Acid (724L30Y2QR)', 'Cholesterol (97C5T2UQ7J)']"

We have previously demonstrated that cortisol-induced cutaneous vasoconstriction in man is potentiated by the 11 beta-OHSD inhibitor glycyrrhetinic acid, suggesting that 11 beta-OHSD may protect vascular corticosteroid receptors. In this study we report quantitation of 11 beta-OHSD bioactivity in homogenates of rat aorta, mesenteric artery, caudal artery, and heart, expressed as the percent in vitro conversion of 3H-corticosterone to 3H-11-dehydrocorticosterone.

Reduction of 3H-11-dehydrocorticosterone to 3H-corticosterone was not detected in these experiments.

Evidence for a 'catalytic switch' at the Qo center.""]","[""The binding characteristics of inhibitors of the mitochondrial cytochrome c reductase were studied by fluorescence quench titration. Based on the standard binding equation, the applied numerical method allowed the online recorded titration curves to be interpreted by fitting the Kd, the number of binding sites, and the specific fluorescence of the free and the bound inhibitor. For the Qi center, 2-n-nonyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide and for the Qo center (E)-beta-methoxyacrylate-stilbene (MOA-stilbene) were used as fluorescing inhibitors. The experiments could be extended to other, non-fluorescing inhibitors by competition analysis. Using this method we were able to compare the binding behaviour of Qi and Qo center inhibitors under different redox states of the enzyme using the same experimental set up. We studied the competition between inhibitors of the cytochrome c reductase representative for all subgroups and demonstrated that at least three inhibitor binding sites exist, two located in the Qo center, one located in the Qi center. Determination of the dissociation constants of the oxidized, the partially reduced and the fully reduced enzyme showed that inhibitor binding at the Qi center is not redox-dependent. In contrast, the binding of MOA-stilbene to the Qo center is decreased after reduction of the iron-sulfur center and cytochrome c1, whereas this redox change increases the affinity for a Qo center inhibitor of the hydroxynaphthoquinone type, 3-n-undecyl-2-hydroxynaphthoquinone. From these results, aware of the fact that the inhibitory mechanism at the Qo center is a non-competitive one, we made the hypothesis of a 'catalytic switch' to explain both the bifurcation of electron flow and the inhibition at the Qo center. A steric blockage of one of two conformational states could serve as a cogent explanation for the great structural variability of the inhibitors and differential effects on the redox centers exerted by the inhibitors. Moreover, the proposed 'switch' gives some insight into other experimental results which are difficult to explain with the ubiquinone cycle as currently formulated.""]",['eng'],"['Acrylates/metabolism', 'Acrylates/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cattle', 'Kinetics', 'Mathematics', 'Mitochondria, Heart/enzymology', 'Models, Theoretical', 'NADH Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Naphthoquinones/metabolism', 'Naphthoquinones/pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Protein Binding', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence/methods', 'Stilbenes/metabolism', 'Stilbenes/pharmacology']","['Acrylates', 'Naphthoquinones', 'Stilbenes', '3-methoxy-2-(2-styrylphenyl)propenic acid methyl ester (103455-29-4)', '2-hydroxy-3-undecyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (41245-59-4)', 'NADH Dehydrogenase (EC 1.6.99.3)']"

Frozen hydrated sections were prepared from cryofixed tissues by ultracryomicrotomy at -125 degrees C. Sections were subsequently freeze-dried by increasing the temperature to -100 degrees C. The latter temperature was maintained throughout both the structural and elemental analyses. In cells from normal, rachitic, and vitamin D-treated [CC] animals the brush border from lanthanum-infused tissues was electron dense and calcium-lanthanum positive by x-ray analysis. In the absence of lanthanum, i.e., sucrose-infused duodena, the microvilli were still calcium positive. In the terminal web region of normal and CC-treated enterocytes, numerous, apparently interconnected, tubules and vesicles were seen. Vacuole-like structures were also seen. Such structures were especially prominent in the enterocytes from the vitamin-treated [CC] animals. Except for the vacuoles, the tubules and vesicles were electron dense in the lanthanum-infused duodena, and clear in sucrose-infused tissues. In both instances, the structures were calcium positive. Similar, but even larger structures were seen below the terminal web. Here however, the tubules and vesicles seemed to be organized into multiple complex interconnecting networks, i.e., tubulo-vesicular complexes. Both the tubules and the vesicles seemed to be interconnected via smaller channel-like entities. The extensiveness of this structure was better appreciated in the enterocytes from lanthanum-infused tissues, where it appeared similar in structure and complexity to an en face view of the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle. These intestinal complexes were less well developed, decreased in number, and quite often absent, in the apical cytoplasm of absorptive cells from rachitic chicks. In the enterocytes from animals treated for 24 hours with 1,25-DHCC, the same highly developed tubulo-vesicular networks were again seen in the enterocyte apical cytoplasm. They were even more developed in the 1,25-DHCC-treated animals. All structures were intensely calcium positive in enterocytes from both the lanthanum- and the sucrose-infused preparations. Numerous endocytotic (pinocytotic) vesicles were seen at the lumenal plasmalemma. Similar structures were also apparent in the terminal web region of the 1,25-DHCC-treated enterocytes. Exocytotic vesicles were seen at the apical aspect of the lateral cell membrane, below the level of the junctional complex.

Instability of Mex- has previously been shown as a population phenotype of LCLs. We examined whether Mex- as a cellular phenotype is spontaneously convertible or not. At the population doubling number (PDN) 23 after recloning, two out of 15 independent subcultures derived from a Mex- LCL, AT1-1, were found to contain a small fraction of Mex+ cells after treatment with 1-(4-amino-2-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl)methyl-3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitrosourea (ACNU). Three Mex+ subclones were identified without exposure to ACNU among 486 subclones from replica plating of an expanded Mex- clone (PDN30). The rate of spontaneous conversion was estimated to be in the range of 10(-8)-10(-7) per cell per generation by the fluctuation analyses on two Mex- subclones. These results strongly support the hypothesis that Mex- as a cellular phenotype is spontaneously convertible to Mex+.']",['eng'],"['Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Gene Conversion', 'Guanine/analogs & derivatives', 'Guanine/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Methyltransferases/genetics', 'Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'Nimustine/pharmacology', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase', 'Phenotype']","['Nimustine (0S726V972K)', 'Guanine (5Z93L87A1R)', 'O-(6)-methylguanine (9B710FV2AE)', 'Methyltransferases (EC 2.1.1.-)', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.63)']"

The results from 32 respondents demonstrated that 50% of the previous nonflossers were still flossing regularly (i.e., two or more times per week) and of these new regular flossers, 85% were using the floss-holding device while the remaining 15% preferred flossing by hand.

Of 790 singleton pregnancies followed to term, 71 (9.0%) planned home births, 510 (64.6%) planned clinic births, and 209 (26.5%) planned hospital births. Of those planning clinic or home birth, 73% gave birth outside the hospital as planned (44 at home and 379 in the clinic), 81 (14%) changed plans prenatally and gave birth in a local hospital, 46 (8%) were transferred to the local hospital intrapartum, and 29 (5%) were referred to tertiary care. Primiparas who initially chose OHB were more likely than multiparas to give birth in a hospital (46% vs 16%). Controlling retrospectively for obstetric risk and parity, there were few differences in outcome between local hospital and out-of-hospital births. The observed rates of serious complications for OHB were low, but overall, 27% of those initially considered candidates for birth outside the hospital required a change to a higher level of care. For primiparas initially planning clinic or home birth, discriminant analysis revealed five variables that together might have improved the prediction of the eventual decision for hospital delivery in 46%. Clinical pelvimetry was the most powerful variable, in keeping with the finding that most intrapartum transfers were for arrests of labor.

A comparison with the mutagenicity in S. typhimurium TA100.'],"['17 monofunctional methanesulphonates of widely varying structures were investigated in the SOS chromotest using the E. coli strain PQ37. All compounds tested were positive in this assay. The monofunctional methanesulphonates in general possess low SOSiP values. Five of the compounds tested i.e. iBMS, NpMS, 2 PhPMS, PkMS and 1,3-DC12PMS (for abbreviations see Table 1) did not show increasing beta-galactosidase activity and both the positive induction factors and the positive SOSiP values resulted from the toxicity correction as performed according to Quillardet and Hofnung (1985). In general methanesulphonates with a higher SN1 reactivity, in particular the secondary compounds, showed clear genotoxic activities whereas those possessing low SN1 reactivities (primary compounds) induced a low SOS repair indicating that the alkylation of O-atoms in the DNA bases contributes more to the induction of SOS repair in strain PQ37 than N-alkylations. The only exception was methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) which possessed a very high SN2 reactivity but a rather low SN1 reactivity. It had the highest SOSiP value of all tested methanesulphonates. No dependence of the genotoxicity on the SN2 reactivity could be found in this series. In general the phenyl-substituted methanesulphonates showed higher SOSiP values, which is presumably due to their relatively high SN1 reactivities and their relatively long life times in aqueous systems. There is a clear relationship between SN1 reactivities and the SOSiP values: the SOSiP values increase with rising SN1 reactivities reaching a maximum at iPMS after which the genotoxicities decrease due to the decreasing life times. The compounds with very high SN1 reactivities also possess very high hydrolysis rates. A good correlation could be established between the mutagenicities in S. typhimurium TA100 and the SOS chromotest (strain PQ37). Only 4 small deviations from this correlation could be found. The reasons for these deviations are discussed.']",['eng'],"['Alkylation', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Escherichia coli/drug effects', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Hydrolysis', 'Mesylates/toxicity', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'SOS Response (Genetics)/drug effects', 'Salmonella typhimurium/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']","['Mesylates', 'beta-Galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23)']"

Most of the techniques used so far (e.g. the super-syringe technique) need an apneic period of approximately 60-120 s, in which the pulmonary gas volume is reduced by the continuing oxygen uptake. Thus, a bias of 200-400 ml in volume is superimposed on the record. In contrast to the super-syringe technique, a new automatic procedure has been developed for which no apneic period is needed. This technique is called the PEEP wave technique: it is based on the imbalance between inspiratory and expiratory volumes after a sudden change in PEEP. The software of a Dräger Evita respirator was adapted to allow automatic application of a special sequence of respiratory cycles with stepwise increase and decreases in PEEP between two preselectable borderline levels. The equipment is switched to the next PEEP level when the difference between two consecutive expiratory tidal volumes is less than 15 ml. After the highest level of PEEP is reached the procedure is reversed until PEEP returns to its initial value.

Such LCLs have been designated Mex-, while the proficient LCLs are Mex+. Our determinations of O6-AGT activity as a function of cellular protein concentration on 37 previously-established LCLs disclosed that the expression of the enzyme was high in 14 (Mex+) and barely detectable in 16 (Mex-). The other seven LCLs showed intermediate activity of the enzyme. By contrast, all of the 28 LCLs that we newly established contained high enzyme activity, implying that they consisted of mainly Mex+ cells. Since the conventional O6-AGT assay on Mex+ cell populations was not capable of detecting the co-existence of Mex- cells as a minor component, we attempted to determine the proportion of Mex- phenotype in newly-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell clones which had been established directly on semisolid agar. All of the 15 independent clones derived from a single blood sample also showed high O6-AGT activity, rendering it unlikely that Epstein-Barr virus transformation per se was responsible for the generation of Mex- LCLs. These results collectively indicate that Mex+ cells predominate in LCLs shortly after establishment and also suggest that the possible growth advantage for Mex- cells should play an important role in the subsequent development of Mex- LCLs during the long-term culture in vitro.']",['eng'],"['Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'Nimustine/toxicity', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase', 'Phenotype']","['Nimustine (0S726V972K)', 'Methyltransferases (EC 2.1.1.-)', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.63)']"

This protocol was made valid in 6 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) admitted to a coronary care unit, 24 h after the onset of pain. From both the i.v. and oral plasma level data, the pharmacokinetic parameter alterations of MEX and its hydroxymethylmexiletine metabolite (OH MEX) were evaluated over a week's period. The results presented here demonstrate that a twice daily oral SR MEX administration, starting at the end of MEX infusion, maintains the therapeutic concentrations of MEX (750-2000 ng/ml) previously achieved by infusion therapy (at 48 h, end of infusion, mean +/- SD = 1393 +/- 325 ng/ml; at 60 h, mean +/- SD = 1434 +/- 376 ng/ml; at 96 h, mean +/- SD = 1423 +/- 367 ng/ml.

In an effort to move closer to the HD gene, with the eventual goal of identifying the gene itself, we have applied the technique of chromosome jumping to this region. A 200-kilobase jumping library has been constructed, and a jump from D4S10 has been obtained and its approximate distance verified by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Two restriction fragment length polymorphisms have been identified at the jump locus, which is denoted D4S81. Linkage analysis of previously identified recombinants between D4S10 and HD or D4S10 and D4S43 shows that in two of five events the jump has crossed the recombination points. This unequivocally orients D4S10 and D4S81 on the chromosome, provides additional markers for HD, and suggests that recombination frequency in this region of chromosome 4 may be increased, so that the physical distance from D4S10 to HD may not be as large as originally suspected.']",['eng'],"['Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Huntington Disease/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length']",

To address this situation, a general human chromosome jumping library was constructed that allows the cloning of DNA sequences approximately 100 kilobases away from any starting point in genomic DNA. As an illustration of its usefulness, this library was searched for a jumping clone, starting at the met oncogene, which is a marker tightly linked to the cystic fibrosis gene that is located on human chromosome 7.

The antisera were used to detect the two electron transferases in control and GA II fibroblasts by immunoblotting. Fibroblasts from three unrelated GA II patients were deficient in immunologically detectable ETF:QO and extracts from these three fibroblast lines contained no detectable ETF:QO catalytic activity. Fibroblasts from parents of two of these patients had ETF:QO activity intermediate between activities in control fibroblasts and fibroblasts from the patients. These data indicate that the primary defect in these patients is a deficiency of ETF:QO and that the mode of transmission of the gene is autosomal recessive. Fibroblasts from two other patients with severe GA II had normal levels of ETF-QO activity and antigen but were deficient in immunoreactive ETF. These findings show that GA II results from a deficiency of ETF in some patients and ETF:QO in others.

Infusion for 20 h of either human PTH-(1-34) (except at 800 pmol/h) or cAMP did not significantly change the plasma levels of calcium and phosphorus compared with those in thyroparathyroidectomized rats given 125 ng 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to induce renal 24-hydroxylase activity. On the other hand, human PTH-(1-34) markedly inhibited renal 24-hydroxylase activity and stimulated 1-hydroxylase activity. The effective concentration of human PTH-(1-34) was much lower for inhibiting 24-hydroxylase than for stimulating 1-hydroxylase activity. Infusion of less than 100 nmol/h cAMP similarly inhibited 24-hydroxylase activity without enhancing 1-hydroxylase activity. Either theophylline (1.0 mumol/h) or a submaximal dose (25 pmol/h) of human PTH-(1-34) alone inhibited 24-hydroxylase activity only slightly, but the concomitant infusion of both chemicals markedly inhibited 24-hydroxylase activity without stimulating 1-hydroxylase activity.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the dose responsivity of this perfused intestinal calcium transport system for 1,25(OH)2D3 and some structurally related congeners. The dose-response curve was biphasic for all compounds studied; for 1,25(OH)2D3 initial stimulation of transport was detected at only 30 pM [the plasma concentration of 1,25(OH)2D3 is normally 125 pM] while maximal stimulation was 154% above control at a concentration of 650 pM. Above 650 pM 1,25(OH)2D3 the stimulation fell off sharply and transport had returned to basal levels by 1.3 nM.

At all calcium concentrations used net secretion of calcium was observed. The s to m flux of the simultaneously measured paracellular marker mannitol at all calcium concentrations was remarkably higher than the m to s flux, resulting in net mannitol secretion.

PEEP is thought to increase PaO2 by alveolar recruitment, which in turn, has been hypothesized to play a decisive role in pulmonary recovery. One hundred and eighteen patients were followed prospectively, and after development of decreased PaO2, randomized to receive recruitive PEEP (determined by blood gas criteria) or supportive PEEP (the minimal PEEP required to maintain PaO2 above 60 mm Hg on .5 inspired O2 fraction (FIO2). No prognostic factors were significantly different between the two groups. Recruitive PEEP application in 22 patients yielded a significantly increased incidence of hypotension (55 percent), pneumothorax (20 percent), and death during treatment (27 percent) when compared to the 28 supportive PEEP patients who had no hypotension or pneumothorax and only one death during treatment (4 percent). After PEEP treatment, deaths in each group were similar (19 percent and 15 percent, respectively).

In 16 intensive care patients the low VA/Q component was evaluated by determining the arterio-alveolar nitrogen partial pressure difference (aADN2). Employing a two compartment model of the lung, the fractional blood flow to a perfused and open, gas-filled but non-ventilated compartment (VA/Q = O) which represents all low VA/Q areas was calculated (QO/QT) from the aADN2 data. These results were compared with continuous ventilation-perfusion distributions obtained by using the multiple inert gas elimination technique. There was a close relationship between QO/QT and the perfusion fraction to lung regions with VA/Q ratios less than 0.6 (r = 0.855, p less than 0.001). The difference QVA/QT-QO/QT yielded a close estimation of the QS/QT value computed according to the SF6 retention (r = 0.952, p less than 0.001).

The out-of-hospital birth phenomenon was diffuse throughout the state, with more births attended by midwives than physicians and more births at home rather than at birthing centers. This study provides a basis for comparison of specific choices, providers and clientelle involved in the birth alternative movement, and lays the groundwork for investigating long term changes in the demand for birthing services in New Jersey.']",['eng'],"['Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Delivery, Obstetric', 'Female', 'Home Childbirth', 'Hospitals, Maternity/statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitals, Special/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Midwifery/statistics & numerical data', 'New Jersey', 'Pregnancy']",

Two transparent plastic ""tracheas"" with cuffed and uncuffed endotracheal tubes simulated adult and paediatric airways respectively. Ten trials without PEEP and ten with PEEP at each of two different levels were completed for each model using both SV and MV. Simulated SV in both models was associated with seepage nearly 100 per cent of the time, regardless of PEEP level. During MV without PEEP, seepage occurred in 55 per cent of the adult trials and 100 per cent of the paediatric trials. In contrast, MV with 5 cmH2O PEEP produced seepage rates of 15 per cent in the adult model and 0 per cent in the paediatric model. Compared to trials without PEEP, seepage occurred less frequently, was reduced in amount and delayed in onset. MV with PEEP significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased the incidence of seepage around endotracheal tubes.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Intubation, Intratracheal/instrumentation', 'Models, Structural', 'Pneumonia, Aspiration/prevention & control', 'Positive-Pressure Respiration', 'Respiration, Artificial']",

The musical notation in braille remained intact: he could read by touch and play unfamiliar scores, he could also read and sing the musical notes, he could copy and write a score. Nine months after the stroke his aphasia remained unchanged. Nevertheless he composed pieces for the organ which were published. Such data highly suggest the independence of linguistic and musical competences, defined as the analysis and organization of sounds according to the rules of music. This independence in an extremely talented musician leads to a discussion of the role of the right hemisphere in the anatomical-functional processes at the origin of musical competence.

The particles also catalyze the ATP-dependent reduction of NAD+ by enzymatically reduced ETF. The latter reaction is inhibited by rotenone and carbonyl cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone and all three reactions are inhibited by antibody to electrontransfer flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETF-QO). These observations indicated that ETF-QO reacts with the pool of ubiquinone that is reduced by NADH and succinic dehydrogenases. Consistent with this hypothesis, NADH- and succinic-ETF reductase activities are inhibited 99% in ubiquinone-depleted particles, and reincorporation of exogenous ubiquinone restores at least 90% of these activities. Reduction of the bc1 complex by ETF and acyl CoA oxidase activity are also inhibited by antibody to ETF-QO. Myxothiazole and antimycin which inhibit the quinonol oxidation and quinone reduction sites, respectively, in the bc1 complex also inhibit electron transport from ETF-QO through the complex according to current models of the Q-cycle (Rich, P.R. (1986) J. Bioenerg. Biomembranes 18, 145-156).

The mean annual decline in rates between the surveys appeared to be greater for the Indian and the Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups, 15% and 16% respectively, than for the white ethnic group (7%). Data from two small sample population surveys, the National Dwelling and Housing Survey in 1978 and the Labour Force Survey in 1983, were used to calculate the rates. However, comparison of the estimates for the population of Indian subcontinent ethnic origin in England from these surveys revealed discrepancies between them. Additional information from the Labour Force Survey on the year of first entry to the United Kingdom (UK) permitted the calculation of new estimates for the 1978 population, and based on these estimates the annual notification rates for 1978/79 were 287 per 100,000 for the Indian and 286 per 100,000 for the Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups. The rates for 1983 were 178 and 169 respectively, and the mean annual decline between the surveys was 11% for the Indian and 12% for the Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups. There were important changes in the characteristics of the population of Indian subcontinent ethnic origin in England between 1978 and 1983, and therefore the rates for both surveys have been standardised by the method of direct standardisation to a common reference population. Standardizing for year of entry to the UK, place of birth (UK or abroad), age, and sex reduced the mean annual decline in the notification rate to 4% for the Indian and 9% for the Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups. The much greater reduction in the rate of decline in the Indian ethnic group is due to the substantial decline between the surveys in the proportion of recent immigrants, the group with the highest annual notification rate, in that population. Future trends will continue to be influenced by immigration patterns, but it will also be important to monitor the rates among the increasing proportion of the population born in the UK or resident in England for more than five years.']",['eng'],"['Bangladesh/ethnology', 'Demography', 'England', 'Humans', 'India/ethnology', 'Pakistan/ethnology', 'Tuberculosis/epidemiology', 'Tuberculosis/ethnology']",

Histological examination of iliac crest bone biopsy after double labelling with tetracycline showed normal bone trabeculation volume, surface of resorption and rates of calcification. However, the relative osteoid volume was increased and there was a much higher osteoid thickness index. These observations may be explained by a global decrease in the activation and activity of the multicellular units of bone remodeling due to the general slowing of cellular metabolism encountered in that condition.']",['fre'],"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Diseases/etiology', 'Bone Diseases/physiopathology', 'Bone and Bones/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypothyroidism/complications', 'Hypothyroidism/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Thyroid Hormones/physiology']",['Thyroid Hormones']

Fifty total changes in PEEP were studied in 19 PEEP trials performed in 16 patients. The initial patterns of ventilation-perfusion distribution as measured by the multiple inert gas elimination technique showed a large shunt flow (32 +/- 14% of total cardiac output), which was accompanied in half of the patients by perfusion to a region of low ventilation-perfusion ratio (VA/Q ratio less than 0.1). In 17 PEEP trials, there was an improvement in PaO2 (increase in PaO2 greater than 10 mmHg over control value) with at least one level of PEEP tested. In the 38 PEEP increments in these trials where PaO2 did improve, there was either a reduction in shunt alone, a reduction in ventilation-perfusion regions alone, or a redistribution in blood flow from shunt to regions of low or normal ventilation-perfusion ratio. In the increments where no increase was observed in PaO2, this reduction in blood flow to shunt or low VA/Q regions did not occur. In some instances, there was an increase in ventilation to unperfused alveoli and evidence of high ventilation-perfusion ratio (VA/Q greater than 10) as the level of PEEP increased. Because patients had an adequate pulmonary artery wedge pressure at the start of the PEEP trial (mean wedge pressure, 12.8 +/- 1.5 mmHg) improvements in oxygenation could usually be attained with only mild decreases in cardiac output.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cardiac Output', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Positive-Pressure Respiration', 'Pulmonary Gas Exchange', 'Pulmonary Wedge Pressure', 'Respiratory Dead Space', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult/physiopathology', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult/therapy', 'Ventilation-Perfusion Ratio']",

The use of operating rooms supplied with ultra-clean air was also associated with a reduction in infection after insertion of a prosthetic joint. These studies suggest that ultra-clean air and antibiotic prophylaxis have independent and cumulative effects in preventing joint infection following surgery. Foci of infection elsewhere in the body can seed a prosthetic joint and, therefore, must be treated vigorously. However, there are no convincing data as to the potential risk to the prosthetic joint of procedures such as dental work or gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract manipulation. Currently, antibiotic prophylaxis for all patients with prosthetic joints about to undergo such procedures cannot be recommended.']",['eng'],"['Air Microbiology', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Cements', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Hip Fractures/surgery', 'Hip Prosthesis', 'Humans', 'Operating Rooms', 'Premedication', 'Surgical Wound Infection/prevention & control', 'Time Factors']","['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bone Cements']"

It is comparable in molecular weight and general properties to ETF-QO from beef heart [Ruzicka, F. J., & Beinert, H. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 8440-8445], and the electron spin resonance signals of the reduced iron-sulfur cluster are essentially identical. ETF-QO catalyzes the transfer of electrons from electron-transfer flavoprotein (ETF) to nitro blue tetrazolium, with a sluggish reaction turnover number of about 10-30 min-1. In contrast, the enzyme rapidly disproportionates ETF semiquinone, with a turnover number of 200 s-1. The reverse reaction, comproportionation of oxidized and hydroquinone ETF, provides an enzymatic assay for ETF-QO with picomolar sensitivity. Equilibrium spectrophotometric titrations show that ETF-QO accepts a maximum of two electrons from ETF and accepts three electron equivalents from dithionite or by photochemical reduction. All electrons from the enzymatically or chemically reduced protein can be transferred to 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-pentyl-1,4-benzoquinone (PB), and this reaction is readily reversible. Reduction of ETF-QO by 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-pentyl-1,4-benzohydroquinone is pH dependent and indicates the enzyme to have a redox potential that decreases by 47 mV per pH unit. Therefore, ETF-QO binds one to two protons upon reduction. The EO' at pH 7.3 is 38 mV. The ability of ETF-QO to catalyze the equilibration of ETF redox states has been used to evaluate the equilibrium 2ETFsq + nH+ in equilibrium ETFox + ETFhq.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)""]",['eng'],"['Amino Acids/analysis', 'Animals', 'Electron Transport', 'Electron-Transferring Flavoproteins', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases/isolation & purification', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases/metabolism', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Iron/analysis', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins', 'Kinetics', 'Mathematics', 'Mitochondria, Liver/enzymology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multienzyme Complexes/isolation & purification', 'Multienzyme Complexes/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors', 'Phospholipids/analysis', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Submitochondrial Particles/enzymology', 'Swine']","['Amino Acids', 'Electron-Transferring Flavoproteins', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins', 'Multienzyme Complexes', 'Phospholipids', 'Iron (E1UOL152H7)', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases (EC 1.14.19.-)', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors (EC 1.5.-)', 'electron-transferring-flavoprotein dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.5.1)']"

Patterns of inheritance of C6 variants in families carrying a silent gene for C6 were examined, and it was found that 3 common plasma phenotypic variants, C6 A, C6 B, and C6 QO were under the genetic control of allelic genes, C6*A, C6*B, and C6*QO. In IEF patterns, C6 A could be identified by its isoelectric point that was slightly more acidic than that of C6 B. C6 QO was undetectable because it lacked functional and antigenic activity. The C6*A/C6*B genotype displayed a mixed IEF pattern with bands characteristic of both C6 A and C6 B. Functional and antigenic levels of C6 that were found in heterozygous C6*A/C6*QO and C6*B/C6*QO rabbits were approximately one-half of the C6 levels found in the corresponding homozygous animals. The phenotypic variation closely resembles that previously observed in humans and rhesus monkeys, as well as preliminary data in rabbits. The patterns of inheritance indicated that the two common C6 structural genes and the deficiency gene were allelic variants at the same genetic locus.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Complement C6/deficiency', 'Complement C6/genetics', 'Complement C6/immunology', 'Epitopes', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Immune Sera/pharmacology', 'Isoantibodies/biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Pedigree', 'Phenotype', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Rabbits/genetics']","['Complement C6', 'Epitopes', 'Immune Sera', 'Isoantibodies']"

The metabolism of an intravenous pulse-dose of 65 nmol (25 microgram) of double-isotope-labelled cholecalciferol has been studied in 28 individuals. The subjects comprised 19 with serum concentrations of 25-hydroxycalciferol (25-(OH)D) less than or equal to 25 nmol/l, of whom 12 had clinical osteomalacia, and nine with serum 25-(OH)D > 25 nmol/l (30-125 nmol/l). 2. The concentrations in serum of radioactive cholecalciferol, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-(OH)D3) and the three dihydroxylated metabolites: 1,25-, 24,25- and 25,26-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-(OH)2D3, 24,25-(OH)2D3 and 25,26-(OH)2D3) were measured for up to 10 days after the injection. 3. The temporal relationships between the formation of individual radioactive metabolites and factors apparently influencing their production are described and their molar concentrations in serum calculated. 4. Formation of radioactive 1,25-(OH)2D3 was detectable only in vitamin D-deficient subjects. Between individuals, its maximum serum concentration was correlated significantly and inversely with serum calcium but with not other measured variable. In the individual, concentrations of radioactive serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 varied directly with radioactive serum 25-(OH)D3. 5. The failure to detect formation of radioactive 1,25-(OH)2D3 in vitamin D-replete subjects suggests that current estimates of the daily turnover of the hormone in the normal individual may be severalfold too high. 6. Radioactive 25,26-(OH)2D3 was produced rapidly by all subjects and in greater amounts by vitamin D-deficient individuals. Between subjects and in the individual its concentration in serum correlated only with the radioactive serum 25-(OH)D3. Production of this metabolite appeared to be unregulated and dependent solely on the concentration of its precursor. 7. In vitamin D-replete subjects, production of 24,25-(OH)2D3 was also apparently determined by precursor concentration. In vitamin D-depleted subjects, production of radioactive 24,25-(OH)2D3 was variably delayed for up to or more than 10 days. 8. There appeared to be a constraint on the quantitative hepatic production of 25-(OH)D which is not explained by simple feed-back inhibition. 9. If sterols other than 1,25-(OH)2D3 are required to initiate the mineralization of osteomalacic bone, after correction of vitamin D deficiency in man, 25-(OH)D3 and 25,26-(OH)2D3 are produced sufficiently rapidly to meet this hypothetical requirement, but not 24,25-(OH)2D3.']",['eng'],"['Cholecalciferol/blood', 'Dihydroxycholecalciferols/blood', 'Humans', 'Hydroxycholecalciferols/blood', 'Hydroxylation', 'Osteomalacia/blood']","['Dihydroxycholecalciferols', 'Hydroxycholecalciferols', 'Cholecalciferol (1C6V77QF41)']"

When controls were applied for birth attendant, infants' race, and mothers' education, age, nativity, and parity, the data revealed that white, well-educated women between 25 and 39 years of age, who were having their second babies and were attended by midwives out of hospital, were at least risk of bearing low birth weight infants. The incidence rate of low birth weight babies was lower for midwife-attended births in every category examined. For college-educated white women, for example, the incidence rate was 2.0 percent among those attended by midwives, 4.6 percent among those giving birth in hospital, and 3.6 percent among those whose out-of-hospital deliveries were attended by physicians. Apgar scores for babies born both in and out of hospital were also studied but, because of inconsistent reporting, were given less attention. Excellent (9-10) Apgar scores were more common among babies born out of hospital than among those born in hospital (63 percent compared with 49 percent), particularly for out-of-hospital births attended by physicians. At least with respect to birth weight and Apgar scores, the claim that out-of-hospital births are inherently more dangerous than hospital births receives no support from these data. The findings also suggest the need for further refinement of vital statistics categories to permit the analysis of distinctions between births attended by certified nurse-midwives and those attended by lay midwives, as well as differences between births at home and those in alternative birth centers.""]",['eng'],"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'African Americans', 'Apgar Score', 'Birth Weight', 'Delivery, Obstetric', 'Educational Status', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'European Continental Ancestry Group', 'Female', 'Home Childbirth', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Infant, Low Birth Weight', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Nurse Midwives', 'Parity', 'Pregnancy', 'United States']",

However, within the group of women having out-of-hospital delivery, characteristics which predicted neonatal death included being white, aged less than 20, primiparous, and unmarried and having little or no prenatal care. Both the risk factors for and outcomes of out-of-hospital birth differed markedly by race. In all, out-of-hospital births, which declined from 25% to 0.5% of all births from 1940 to 1980, were associated with a twofold increase in neonatal mortality. The major care provider for out-of-hospital births, the ""granny"" midwife, was found to have little knowledge about, or ability to provide, modern obstetric care.

The technique of near-neighbor analysis of MTs (as developed by McDonald et al. [9]) in the mid-region of the Ochromonas spindle (overlap) shows that MTs from one pole preferentially associate with MTs from the opposite pole at a center-to-center distance of 35 to 43 nm. However, in the half spindle between the chromosomes and the poles, kinetochore MTs (kMTs) do not preferentially associate with other MTs in the half spindle but instead are arranged essentially at random. Individual polar MTs (MTs attached to one pole), kMTs and free MTs (MTs unattached to the poles) were selected for near-neighbor analysis over their entire lengths. The spacing of MTs in the overlap is compatible with those models for mitosis which propose that separation of the poles is accomplished by sliding between closely spaced MTs of opposite polarity. In contrast to the overlap, the arrangement of MTs in the half spindle is not compatible with MT2MT sliding theories that propose that chromosome movement is accomplished by sliding between kMTs and polar MTs.']",['eng'],"['Anaphase', 'Chromosomes/ultrastructure', 'Eukaryota/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microtubules/ultrastructure', 'Mitosis']",

Addition of 11 mM D-glucose to the bathing medium consistently increased calcium Js leads to m and mannitol Jm leads to s and Js leads to m. Glucose reduced net calcium absorption except when sodium was removed from the medium. Calcium Js leads to m varied linearly with mannitol Js leads to m over the range of medium calcium from 0.125 to 5.0 mM.

Addition of papain to brush borders isolated from vitamin D3-treated and deficient chicks resulted in a differential solubilization of leucine aminopeptidase, maltase, and sucrase activities (114, 195, and 79%, respectively, of appropriate control levels) but not alkaline phosphatase activity. In comparison, proteolysis of purified membranes exhibited vitamin D3- and 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25(OH)2D3]-dependent differences in release of all four marker hydrolases monitored. Calcium uptake studies revealed that preincubation with papain yielded vesicles with a calcium content that was 125% of corresponding native vesicles, in preparations from vitamin D3-treated, as well as deficient birds. Membrane vesicles prepared from 1,25(OH)2D3-treated chicks initially accumulated calcium to a greater extent than those from rachitic birds, but thereafter exhibited a decline in calcium content to basal levels. Preincubation with papain, however, abolished this loss of calcium. The combined results indicate that vitamin D mediates alterations in brush border protein topography and raise the possibility that this action of the seco-steroid might be involved in calcium absorption. However, if vitamin D-stimulated calcium transport across the brush border is dependent on a protein carrier, the molecular entity is not sensitive to inactivation by papain.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Chickens', 'Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Intestinal Absorption/drug effects', 'Intestinal Mucosa/enzymology', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Microvilli/drug effects', 'Microvilli/metabolism', 'Papain/pharmacology', 'Vitamin D/physiology']","['Membrane Proteins', 'Vitamin D (1406-16-2)', 'Hydrolases (EC 3.-)', 'Papain (EC 3.4.22.2)', 'Calcium (SY7Q814VUP)']"

The learned reduction of monitored EMG levels was accompanied by a reduction in the child's motoric activity level to below that which had been achieved by past administration of Ritalin. In addition, the attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity was no longer diagnosable following the EMG biofeedback training.

The disease was first diagnosed in 1978. Demographic data was collected from 50 households comprising 374 individuals. Clinical examination, laboratory investigations and leishmanin skin tests were performed. The results showed that in spite of the presence of a susceptible population, visceral leishmaniasis occurred with a low prevalence in Kivaa as evidenced by the small number of individuals with active disease (0.30%), a low leishmanin positivity rate (7.2%) and the presence of leishmanial antibodies in only 3.7% of the population. The infection affected individuals in homesteads with or without nearby termite hills. Leishmanial antibodies and leishmanin positivity were found among asymptomatic household contacts of patients as well as in isolated individuals in non-infected homesteads. These findings suggest the existence of a spectrum of disease ranging from asymptomatic to self-healing to severe clinical illness. Furthermore, there was significant clustering of leishmanin reactors in the households of patients. The aetiology of this striking focality of visceral leishmaniasis remains obscure.

Possible factors related to this seeming paradox are discussed, including the evidence that many of Freud's psychoanalytic colleagues were then actively interested in hypnosis and the negative value associated with the modality had been lifted during the time when Polgar reported that Freud himself was utilizing the method.

Two trials were completed under each of the following conditions: normal, positive end-expiratory pressure breathing (PEEP) during the work, and PEEP post-exercise. For each trial, forced vital capacity maneuvers (FVC) were completed twice at rest, at the 3rd and 6th min of exercise, and every 5 min during the 20-min recovery. No significant effects of PEEP in resting pulmonary function values was found nor was PET CO2 altered for rest, exercise, or recovery for PEEP vs normal trials. For the normal exercise tests, post-exercise broncho-constriction was shown by at 30% to 50% decrease in FEV1.0, 30% to 40% drop in PEF, and a 45% to 65% decrease in maximal flow at 50% VC (MEF50), comparing post-exercise values to rest. PEEP during and PEEP post conditions significantly (P less than 0.01) decreased the severity of exercise-induced asthma (EIA) as PEFR and FEV1.0 values remained within 20% of rest levels and MEF50 within 30%. Since PET CO2 was not altered by the PEEP conditions, the airway response cannot be mediated through CO2 effect, It is known that PEEP does reduce air trapping, but since PEEP during work had a lasting effect into recovery this indicates that some additional mechanism may be involved.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Asthma/therapy', 'Asthma, Exercise-Induced/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Positive-Pressure Respiration', 'Pulmonary Ventilation']",

The occurrence of antibodies in plasma, induced against aldosterone, corticosterone or even cortisone resulted in a marked decrease in the MCR of the corresponding steroid, to the level measured in controls for cortisol. We deduced that, in rabbits: (1) the MCR of a corticosteroid is clearly connected with its binding to a specific protein; (2) in spite of the relatively high binding affinity of transcortin for corticosterone as compared to other species it nevertheless appears unable to significantly protect the steroid against peripheral metabolism; (3) a very effective protection is however, induced, by raising a specific antibody with a high binding affinity for corticosterone.']",['eng'],"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/immunology', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/metabolism', 'Aldosterone/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Corticosterone/analogs & derivatives', 'Corticosterone/metabolism', 'Cortisone/metabolism', 'Female', 'Hydrocortisone/metabolism', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Rabbits/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcortin/metabolism']","['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Antibodies', 'Aldosterone (4964P6T9RB)', 'Transcortin (9010-38-2)', '11-dehydrocorticosterone (FO4V44A3G3)', 'Cortisone (V27W9254FZ)', 'Corticosterone (W980KJ009P)', 'Hydrocortisone (WI4X0X7BPJ)']"

During its various stages of growth, 17 different species of insects were detected, out of which only the cotton flea beetle Podagrica puncticollis Weise is of economic importance. The attack by this pest is most serious in the seedling stage; late sowings coupled with early light showers suffer the heaviest damage. In the leaves the beetles eat out round holes ('shot-hole effect'). The entire life cycle takes about 4 to 5 weeks, and about five generations are completed on the plant depending on the weather conditions.

In 100 of these samples we detected an abnormal hemoglobin pattern using TLIF. In contrast, we detected only 80 abnormal samples by CAC, 70 by CAG, and 80 by using the combination of CAC and CAG. Due to the increased resolution provided by TLIF, we correctly diagnosed two sickle cell trait samples by TLIF that were incorrectly suspected to be homozygous for sickle cell disease by CAC and CAG. We identified 41 samples containing Bart's hemoglobin by TLIF in contrast to only 21 using CAC and 14 using CAG.

Eleven spindles were sectioned and used for numerical data, but only four were reconstructed: a metaphase, an early anaphase, a late anaphase, and telophase. Four major classes of MTs are observed: (a) free MTs (MTs not attached to either pole); (b) interdigitated MTs (MTs attached to one pole which laterally associate with MTs from the opposite pole); (c) polar MTs (MTs attached to one pole); (d) kinetochore MTs (kMTs). Pole-to-pole MTs are rare and may be caused by tracking errors. During anaphase, the kMTs, free MTs, and polar MTs shorten until most disappear, while interdigitated MTs lengthen. In the four reconstructed spindles, the number of MTs decreases between early anaphase and telophase from 881 to 285, while their average length increases from 1.66 to 4.98 micron. The total length of all the MTs in the spindle (placed end to end) remains at 1.42 +/- 0.04 mm between these stages. At late anaphase and telophase the spindle is comprised mainly of groups of interdigitated MTs. Such MTs from opposite poles form a region of overlap in the middle of the spindle. During spindle elongation (separation of the poles), the length of the overlap region does not decrease. These results are compatible with theories that suggest that MTs directly provide the force that elongates the spindle, either by MT polymerization alone or by MT sliding with concomitant MT polymerization.']",['eng'],"['Anaphase', 'Chlorophyta/physiology', 'Chlorophyta/ultrastructure', 'Metaphase', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microtubules/physiology', 'Microtubules/ultrastructure', 'Mitosis', 'Organoids/ultrastructure', 'Telophase']",

Recently, attention has been directed toward elevating MAP by establishing auto-PEEP when ventilating with an inverse inspiratory to expiratory ratio in opposition to applied PEEP. We theorized that FRC distribution and local lung unit end-expiratory pressure (EEP) would be different when equal levels of PEEP were established by applying PEEP or by producing auto-PEEP.!##!Methods!#!Using a four-chamber lung model with each chamber having a different time constant (TC), we applied equal levels of applied PEEP (I:E ratio 1:3) and auto-PEEP (I:E ratio 3:1) and evaluated local lung unit EEP and end expiratory lung volume (EELV).!##!Results!#!During all trials with applied PEEP, local lung unit EEP was equal to applied PEEP, whereas during auto-PEEP local EEP differed (p < 0.01). At a tracheal auto-PEEP level of 12.7 cm H2O, the lung unit with the longest TC (slow lung unit) had an EEP of 15.8 cm H2O, while the shortest TC unit (fast lung unit) had an EEP of 10.1 cm H2O (p < 0.01). Similarly, local EELVs were more maldistributed with auto-PEEP than with applied PEEP. At a tracheal PEEP level of 12.7 cm H2O, the EELV increase in the slow lung unit with auto-PEEP was 1,054 mL vs 918 with applied PEEP (p < 0.01), whereas the fast lung unit's EELV increase with auto-PEEP was 142 mL compared with 212 mL with applied PEEP (p < 0.01).!##!Conclusion!#!Comparing equal levels of the auto-PEEP with applied PEEP, a greater maldistribution of local lung unit EEP and EELV was established with the auto-PEEP.

No specific performance index score exist, however, for patients with glioma. The Barthel Index, has been used in our department because it has been widely used in patients following stroke and found useful. This study aims to establish whether a modification of the Barthel Index would be more appropriate for patients with glioma and, if so, what modifications should be made. The opinions of multidisciplinary health workers and carers experienced in helping patients with glioma were established by questionnaire. Difficulty with speech and the presence of seizures were statistically ranked the most significant disability in terms of overall performance status. As these are not included in the Barthel Index a modification is justified. However, to include new categories in a performance index but avoid increasing its complexity, existing categories have to be omitted. Therefore, the second aim of this study was to establish which categories within the Barthel contribute least to a change in the total score. Three-hundred-and-thirty-three prospectively recorded Barthel scores were evaluated in 81 patients over 2 years and the individual categories evaluated by multifactor analysis. The sensitivity of the categories 'bowel function' and 'independence in grooming' to a change in the total score was less than 1%. In conclusion, substituting 'speech difficulties' and the presence of seizure in place of 'bowel function' and 'independence in grooming' from the Barthel Index will improve the specificity for patients with glioma without reducing the sensitivity or acceptability for the patients and research nurses who most often complete them.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)""]",['eng'],"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Brain Neoplasms/physiopathology', 'Brain Neoplasms/rehabilitation', 'Glioma/physiopathology', 'Glioma/rehabilitation', 'Humans', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of Illness Index']",

For DSPC:PEG-lipid suspensions containing 0-60 mol % PEG-lipid, differential scanning calorimetry shows main endothermic transitions ranging from 55 to 64 degrees C, depending on the size of the PEG and concentration of PEG-lipid. The enthalpy of this main transition remains constant for all PEG-350 concentrations but decreases with increasing amounts of PEG-750, PEG-2000, or PEG-5000, ultimately disappearing at PEG-lipid concentrations greater than about 60 mol %. Low-angle and wide-angle x-ray diffraction show that tilted gel (L beta') phase bilayers are formed for all PEG-lipid molecular weights at concentrations of about 10 mol % or less, with the distance between bilayers depending on PEG molecular weight and PEG-lipid concentration. At PEG-lipid concentrations greater than 10 mol %, the lipid structure depends on the size of the PEG moiety. X-ray diffraction analysis shows that untilted interdigitated (L beta I) gel phase bilayers form with the incorporation of 40-100 mol % PEG-350 or 20-70 mol % PEG-750, and untilted gel (L beta) phase bilayers are formed in the presence of about 20-60 mol % PEG-2000 and PEG-5000. Light microscopy, turbidity measurements, x-ray diffraction, and 1H-NMR indicate that a pure micellar phase forms in the presence of greater than about 60% PEG-750, PEG-2000, or PEG-5000.""]",['eng'],"['Calorimetry, Differential Scanning', 'Liposomes', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Microscopy', 'Models, Structural', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Phosphatidylcholines/chemistry', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Suspensions', 'Thermodynamics', 'X-Ray Diffraction']","['Liposomes', 'Phosphatidylcholines', 'Suspensions', 'Polyethylene Glycols (30IQX730WE)', '1,2-distearoyllecithin (EAG959U971)']"

Such deletions, translocations, and rearrangements presumably result in the disturbance or loss of a critical gene function. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), using NotI linking clones as a probe represent a powerful tool for analyzing such rearrangements. A NotI linking clone, AP20 (D3S1641), was localized by in situ hybridization to 3p21.3-p22. Two NotI jumping clones adjacent to this clone were isolated, clone J32-612 covering 0.5 Mb and clone J31-611 covering approximately 1 Mb. Clone J31-611 crosses the border of the deletion present in hybrid cell line MCH939.2, which contains a deleted 3p21 region. For these jumping clones, corresponding NotI linking clones, NLJ3 (D3S1642) and NL3-003, were isolated. Altogether, linking and jumping clones from the AP20 locus hybridize to NotI fragments totaling 2.5 Mb in length. These NotI-containing clones detect expressed sequences in several human tissues. Clone NLJ3 possesses homology to the human platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor gene and may represent a new member of this gene family. Another clone (AP20) revealed 66% sequence similarity to rat skeletal muscle voltage-sensitive sodium channel subtype 2. Therefore, this group of clones will be useful not only for analyzing rearrangements in tumors, but also for the isolation of new genes from the 3p21.3-p22 region.']",['eng'],"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/genetics', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Analysis']",

To evaluate the prevalence and outcome of these infants, we reviewed medical records of all infants born before arrival at the hospital (out-born infants) and compared them with in-hospital deliveries from July 1988 to June 1992. Data were analyzed using Fisher's Exact Test and chi-square test. There were 151 (1.8%) out-born infants and 8,169 (98.2%) in-born infants during this 4-year period. Infants in both groups were predominantly black (85%). The following were significant differences (P < 0.001) between out-born and in-hospital deliveries, respectively: illicit drug exposure 35% vs 21%; low-birth-weight (< 2,500 g) infants 39% vs 16%; intensive care unit admissions 29% vs 15%; and neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births 80 vs 7. We conclude that there is a twofold increase in the morbidity (required intensive care) and an 11-fold increase in the mortality among out-born infants compared with infants delivered in-hospital.

The action of suckling during breast-feeding minimizes the intake of air. In addition, the direct eye contact that is natural to breast-feeding fosters bonding, and the close body contact promotes a sense of security in the child.

At least two isoforms of 11 beta-HSD exist. One isoform (11 beta-HSD1) has been purified from rat liver and an encoding cDNA cloned from a rat liver library. Transfection of rat 11 beta-HSD1 cDNA into amphibian cells with a mineralocorticoid phenotype encodes 11 beta-reductase activity (activation of inert 11-dehydrocorticosterone) suggesting that 11 beta-HSD1 does not have the necessary properties to protect renal MRs from exposure to glucocorticoids. This function is likely to reside in a second 11 beta-HSD isoform. 11 beta-HSD1 is co-localized with glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and may modulate glucocorticoid access to this receptor type. To examine the predominant direction of 11 beta-HSD1 activity in intact mammalian cells, and the possible role of 11 beta-HSD in regulating glucocorticoid access to GRs, we transfected rat 11 beta-HSD1 cDNA into a mammalian kidney-derived cell system (COS-7) which has little endogenous 11 beta-HSD activity or mRNA expression. Homogenates of COS-7 cells transfected with increasing amounts of 11 beta-HSD cDNA exhibited a dose-related increase in 11 beta-dehydrogenase activity.

Outcomes measured included low birthweight, low five-minute Apgar scores, and neonatal and postneonatal mortality. Associations between attendant and outcomes were measured using odds ratios to estimate relative risks. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression controlled for confounding variables. Overall, births attended by licensed midwives out of hospital had a significantly lower risk for low birthweight than those attended in hospital by certified nurse-midwives, but no significant differences were found between licensed midwives and any of the comparison groups on any other outcomes measured. When the analysis was limited to low-risk women, certified nurse-midwives were no more likely to deliver low-birthweight infants than were licensed midwives, but births attended by physicians had a higher risk of low birthweight.

Logistic regression was used to identify factors that might adversely influence breast feeding 'at discharge', 'at 4 weeks' and the overall 'duration' of breast feeding. When adjusted for confounding factors, not exclusive breast feeding 'at discharge' was significantly associated with: twin pregnancy, being a Pacific Islander, mother not bedsharing, subsequent dummy use, birthweight less than 2500 g, heavy maternal smoking, not attending antenatal classes and mother less than 20 years old at first pregnancy. Mothers smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day were nearly twice as likely to not exclusively breast feed on discharge compared to those who did not smoke. A 'dose response' was apparent with the heaviest smokers having the least likelihood of establishing exclusive breast feeding. Being exclusively breast-fed at discharge but not 'at 4 weeks' was associated with: twin pregnancy, admission to a neonatal intensive care unit, subsequent dummy use and not being married. A shorter overall 'duration' of breast feeding was associated with maternal smoking, subsequent dummy use, mother not bedsharing, twin pregnancy, mother less than 20 years old at first pregnancy, low occupational status and not attending antenatal classes.

In this study, subcellular fractionation was used to demonstrate that FasD is an outer membrane protein. In addition, the accessibility of FasD to proteases established the presence of surface-exposed FasD domains on both sides of the outer membrane. The fasD gene was sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence was shown to share homologous domains with a family of outer membrane proteins from various fimbrial systems. Similar to porins, fimbrial outer membrane proteins are relatively polar, lack typical hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains, and posses secondary structures predicted to be rich in turns and amphipathic beta-sheets. On the basis of the experimental data and structural predictions, FasD is postulated to consist essentially of surface-exposed turns and loops and membrane-spanning interacting amphipathic beta-strands. In an attempt to test this prediction, the fasD gene was submitted to random in-frame linker insertion mutagenesis. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that it was possible to produce fasD mutants, whose products remain functional for fimbrial export and assembly. Subsequently, 11 fasD alleles, containing linker inserts encoding beta-turn-inducing residues, were shown to express functional proteins. The insertion sites were designated permissive sites. The inserts used are expected to be least detrimental to the function of FasD when they are inserted into surface-exposed domains not directly involved in fimbrial export. In contrast, FasD is not expected to accommodate such residues in its amphipathic beta-strands without being destabilized in the membrane and losing function. All permissive sites were sequenced and shown to be located in or one residue away from predicted turns. In contrast, 5 of 10 sequenced nonpermissive sites were mapped to predicted amphipathic beta-strands. These results are consistent with the structural predictions for FasD.']",['eng'],"['Adhesins, Escherichia coli', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Bacterial/genetics', 'Antigens, Surface/genetics', 'Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins/classification', 'Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Fractionation', 'DNA Transposable Elements/genetics', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Fimbriae Proteins', 'Fimbriae, Bacterial', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']","['Adhesins, Escherichia coli', 'Antigens, Bacterial', 'Antigens, Surface', 'Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'antigen 987P, E coli', 'Fimbriae Proteins (147680-16-8)']"

Information pertinent to the diagnosis of ADHD in second-degree relatives was collected from the probands' parents. The second-degree relatives of ADHD probands were at increased risk for ADHD compared with the second-degree relatives of normal control probands. These risks were greatest when the second-degree relative was biologically related to an ADHD parent of an ADHD proband. Consistent with the greater prevalence of ADHD among boys compared with girls, grandfathers were at greater risk than grandmothers and uncles were at greater risk than aunts.

Corticosterone receptors have been found in the cortical collecting tubule, and at least four metabolites of the hormone have been identified in rat renal tissue and urine. The biologic activity of these metabolites is not completely known. In this study, we examined the functional effects of three of the metabolites of corticosterone on membrane transport in toad and turtle bladders; we also analyzed the oxidoreductase pathways for corticosterone metabolism. In the toad bladder, maximal water flow (vasopressin- and cyclic AMP-stimulated) was unaffected by corticosterone, 11-dehydro-20-dihydrocorticosterone (metabolite I) and 11-dehydrocorticosterone (metabolite IV); maximal water flow was significantly inhibited by 20-dihydrocorticosterone (metabolite II). Sodium transport in the toad bladder was stimulated by corticosterone, 11-dehydrocorticosterone and 20-dihydrocorticosterone. Analysis of the oxidoreductase pathways in this tissue revealed that most of the corticosterone was oxidized to 11-dehydrocorticosterone, a biologically active compound; 11-dehydrocorticosterone was further metabolized to 11-dehydro-20-dihydrocorticosterone, a biologically inactive compound. Only 6% of the parent compound was converted to 20-dihydrocorticosterone. In the turtle bladder, none of the metabolites tested altered hydrogen ion secretion over the time period studied; no significant biotransformation of corticosterone occurred in this tissue. As the metabolites of corticosterone found in toad bladder are the same as those identified in mammalian tissues, our studies suggest that some of them may be important modulators of sodium and water transport in the distal nephron. Our data further suggest that these compounds are likely not involved in the regulation of urinary acidification.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Biological Transport/physiology', 'Biotransformation/physiology', 'Bufo marinus/metabolism', 'Corticosterone/analogs & derivatives', 'Corticosterone/pharmacokinetics', 'Corticosterone/pharmacology', 'Membranes/metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Sodium/pharmacokinetics', 'Species Specificity', 'Turtles/metabolism', 'Urinary Bladder/metabolism']","['20-dihydrocorticosterone (35531-74-9)', 'Sodium (9NEZ333N27)', '11-dehydrocorticosterone (FO4V44A3G3)', 'Corticosterone (W980KJ009P)']"

During the period the ECMO centre was contacted in 10 instances. The referring department indicated the ECMO centre correctly in six instances. However, at least in two instances too late and the patients died (during priming of the ECMO circuit or transport could not be implemented because of the critical condition). In two instances, however, the ECMO staff failed as it was unable to ensure a minimum of seven days of safe operation of ECMO and therefore ECMO was not provided. Based on this experience the authors present an organizational model of the ECMO unit which is formed ad hoc when needed and comprises specialists of various professions from the sphere of emergency medicine. The main purpose of the present paper is to inform referring departments on the indications, selection criteria, contraindications of ECMO in neonates and children and to ensure thus not only smooth communication between the ECMO centre and the referring department but in the first place early referral to the ECMO centre at a time when transport is not yet a problem.']",['cze'],"['Adult', 'Child', 'Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation', 'Facility Design and Construction', 'Health Facility Administration', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn']",

Essential role of the phosphodiesterase catalytic core.'],"['Phosphodiesterase (PDE) in bovine retinal rod outer segments is activated when it forms a membrane-bound complex with the alpha-subunit of transducin loaded with GTP (T alpha*). At maximal activation, this complex contains two T alpha* and all the subunits of native PDE (PDE alpha, PDE beta, and two inhibitory PDE gamma). We observed previously (Pagès, F., Deterre, P., and Pfister, C. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 22018-22021) that the rate of GTP hydrolysis by transducin in a rod outer segment suspension is enhanced when T alpha* is bound to native PDE (PDE alpha beta gamma 2). In this article, we compare the effects of PDE species with different PDE gamma contents. We show that T alpha* hydrolyzes its GTP faster not only when bound to PDE alpha beta gamma 2, but also when bound to PDE alpha beta gamma or PDE alpha beta. Moreover, trypsin-treated PDE (PDE gamma-deprived soluble PDE) also induces an acceleration of GTP hydrolysis. On the contrary, addition of isolated PDE gamma alone does not accelerate GTP hydrolysis. The interaction between T alpha* and PDE gamma, which is essential for the activation of PDE by T alpha*, is apparently not responsible of the feedback of PDE on T alpha*. The interaction of primary importance for the acceleration of GTP hydrolysis would be that existing between T alpha* and PDE alpha beta.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Catalysis', 'Cattle', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Hydrolysis', 'Kinetics', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Retinal Rod Photoreceptor Cells/metabolism', 'Transducin/metabolism']","['Membrane Proteins', 'Guanosine Triphosphate (86-01-1)', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases (EC 3.1.4.-)', 'Transducin (EC 3.6.5.1)']"

The subjects were randomized into a control and a vegan diet groups, consisting of 22 and 21 subjects, respectively. The subjects in the vegan diet group received an uncooked vegan diet ('living food') for 3 months, and they were tutored daily by a living-food expert. The subjects in the control group continued their usual diets and received no tutoring. Adherence to the strict vegan diet was assessed on the basis of urinary sodium excretion and by the information on consumption of specific food items (wheatgrass juice and the rejuvelac drink). The use of these drinks was variable, and some boiled vegetables were consumed occasionally. However, only one of the subjects in the vegan diet group lacked a clear decrease in urinary sodium excretion. Rheumatoid patients had lower than recommended intakes of iron, zinc and niacin, and their energy intake was low compared to mean daily energy intake of the healthy Finnish females of the same age. Shifting to the uncooked vegan diet significantly increased the intakes of energy and many nutrients. In spite of the increased energy intake, the group on the vegan diet lost 9% of their body weight during the intervention period, indicating a low availability of energy from the vegan diet.""]",['eng'],"['Arthritis, Rheumatoid/diet therapy', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/metabolism', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/urine', 'Cooking', 'Diet Surveys', 'Diet, Vegetarian', 'Energy Intake', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Female', 'Finland', 'Humans', 'Iron/analysis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Niacin/analysis', 'Nutritional Sciences/education', 'Patient Compliance', 'Sodium/urine', 'Weight Loss', 'Zinc/analysis']","['Niacin (2679MF687A)', 'Sodium (9NEZ333N27)', 'Iron (E1UOL152H7)', 'Zinc (J41CSQ7QDS)']"

M8272902,['Midwifery care and out-of-hospital birth settings: how do they reduce unnecessary cesarean section births?'],"[""In studies using matched or adjusted cohorts, U.S. women beginning labor with midwives and/or in out-of-hospital settings have attained cesarean section rates that are considerably lower than similar women using prevailing forms of care--physicians in hospitals. This cesarean reduction involved no compromise in mortality and morbidity outcome measures. Moreover, groups of women at elevated risk for adverse perinatal outcomes have attained excellent outcomes and cesarean rates well below the general population rate with these care arrangements. How do midwives and out-of-hospital birth settings so effectively help women to avoid unnecessary cesareans? This paper explores this question by presenting data from interviews with midwives who work in home settings. The midwives' understanding of and approaches to major medical indications for cesarean birth contrast strikingly with prevailing medical knowledge and practice. From the midwives' perspective, many women receive cesareans due to pseudo-problems, to problems that might easily be prevented, or to problems that might be addressed through less drastic measures. Policy reports addressing the problem of unnecessary cesarean births in the U.S. have failed to highlight the substantial reduction in such births that may be expected to accompany greatly expanded use of midwives and out-of-hospital birth settings. The present study--together with cohort studies documenting such a reduction, studies showing other benefits of such forms of care, and the increasing reluctance of physicians to provide obstetrical services--suggests that childbearing families would realize many benefits from greatly expanded use of midwives and out-of-hospital birth settings.""]",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Cesarean Section/statistics & numerical data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Misuse/statistics & numerical data', 'Home Childbirth/methods', 'Humans', 'Matched-Pair Analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Nurse Midwives/education', 'Nurse Midwives/psychology', 'Obstetrics', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'United States']",

The AST, ALT, LAP and GTP improved significantly in the UDCA treated patients, whereas ALP, Ch-E and T-cholest. did not show any change throughout the study. Amongst the liver function tests that improved, the serum--GTP level, in particular decreased markedly and rapidly in patients treated with UDCA. Although UDCA 600-mg daily was administered in patients who showed lack of improvement with 300-mg UDCA treatment, no significant improvement was obtained. Repeated liver biopsies were carried out in six of the 42 patients in whom liver biopsy had been performed before the administration of UDCA. We detected no histological changes during the UDCA treatment. There were no side effects related to therapy with UDCA.

In vitro studies demonstrating increased fibroblast collagen synthesis in response to MC are consonant with this view. The nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate(+)-dependent enzyme 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase converts the glucocorticoids corticosterone and cortisol to the inactive metabolites 11-dehydrocorticosterone and cortisone, respectively, conferring mineralocorticoid specificity to the cells within which it is active. We investigated the presence of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in sonicates of cultured vascular endothelial cells and cardiac fibroblasts by incubating sonicates for 1 hour in the presence of 5 x 10(-9) mol/L tritiated corticosterone or tritiated cortisol (1 microCi) and using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to an on-line radioisotope detector for steroid separation and quantitation. Extracts of bovine endothelial cells showed no enzymatic activity with either substrate, whereas extracts of rat cardiac fibroblasts readily converted corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone, even in the absence of exogenous nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate+ (10% conversion). When 5 x 10(-4) mol/L nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate+ was added to sonicated fibroblasts, conversion increased to 50%, corresponding to 12 pmol 11-dehydrocorticosterone formed/mg protein. Conversion of cortisol to cortisone was not observed in fibroblast or endothelial cell extracts. Significant levels of corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone conversion (0.14 pmol/10(6) cells/hour) were detected in intact fibroblasts, but no 11-dehydrogenation of corticosterone was observed in intact endothelial cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)']",['eng'],"['11-Hydroxycorticosteroids/metabolism', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases', 'Animals', 'Aorta', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Corticosterone/metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/enzymology', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology', 'Hydrocortisone/metabolism', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/metabolism', 'Male', 'Myocardium/enzymology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']","['11-Hydroxycorticosteroids', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.-)', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.146)', 'Corticosterone (W980KJ009P)', 'Hydrocortisone (WI4X0X7BPJ)']"

The authors of the present study noted that respiratory frequency did not increase in the earlier experiment and wondered whether respiratory stimulation occurred during acetazolamide administration, as would be expected if CO2 level increases significantly.!##!Method!#!Ten patients with panic disorder and six normal control subjects received injections of acetazolamide, 1 g i.v., as per the Mathew et al. protocol, during breath by breath measurement of both tidal volume and frequency of respiration.!##!Results!#!Three patients had panic attacks, one before receiving acetazolamide, one during the injection, and one 2 minutes after injection.

The analysis is applicable to museum or field-weathered specimens and also to the damage, such as single-strand nicks, which can occur during storage. Two main results are derived: (i) oligonucleotide priming competes extremely effectively against regeneration derived from priming by overlaps of damaged DNA strands. (ii) Extending result (i), it is shown that jumping PCR is not likely to cause inaccurate sequence determination in standard PCR protocols. One exception arises where it is required to determine the sequence of one specified variant of a piece of DNA which is present in many thousand copies. But, generally, experiments can be performed with confidence that the results are very rarely distorted by jumping PCR. The basic model is extended to investigate how to increase the average length of DNA fragments input to PCR experiments. Increased input of less-damaged material to the PCR can theoretically be achieved by performing several cycles of denaturation, re-association and replication on the sample DNA in the absence of exogenous primers. Experimental work will be necessary to confirm this. However, jumping PCR may occur at substantial frequencies during such pretreatment. This problem cannot be avoided but can be reduced in pretreatment protocols by studying sequences (such as mtDNA or rDNA) where multiple copies are subjected to evolutionary homogenizing processes.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Gene Amplification/genetics', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Models, Genetic', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",

It has been proposed that aldosterone selectivity in vivo is achieved by the conversion of corticosterone into its inactive metabolite 11-dehydrocorticosterone by 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta HSD). To test this hypothesis, we transfected rat liver 11 beta HSD cDNA into TBM cells, a sodium-transporting cell line. These cells respond equally well to aldosterone and corticosterone, indicating that endogenous 11 beta HSD is expressed at low levels in TBM cells. Although exogenous rat liver 11 beta HSD was expressed at high levels in transfected cells, mineralocorticoid selectivity was not observed. By contrast, the biologically inactive 11-dehydrocorticosterone was readily converted into corticosterone, a potent agonist for sodium transport. Our results indicate that rat liver 11 beta HSD behaves predominantly as a reductase in TBM cells.

The lateral abdominal muscles, the diaphragm and the pelvic floor are all components of this fasciomuscular support system. Voluntary and reflective changes in muscle tension allow the entry and exit of matter into and out of the spherical abdominal cavity by opening and closing of specialized wall segments called sphincters. We have previously demonstrated the existence of a resting tone in the tail muscles of mammals from which the human pelvic floor muscles are derived. The pelvic floor and its integrated sphincters form the anorectal organ of continence. This organ is much weaker in females than in males. The spinal centers that govern continence, contain in the female significantly fewer ganglion cells than the corresponding centers in the male. Childbirth and a commonly found tendency to develop constipation are additional stressors for the congenitally weaker female organ of continence. We explain in this paper why the abdominal wall and the pelvic floor may suffer stretch-induced denervation injuries during pregnancy and delivery. Such damage may persist in later life and can give rise to incontinence and ""flabby abdomen"". Based on our work in this field, we found a new differentiation between continent and incontinent constipation. Continent constipation is caused by spasticity of the pelvic floor characterized by abnormally high sphincter activity. This spastic pelvic floor syndrome can be treated successfully by psychotherapeutic techniques. Incontinent constipation, in contrast, is always associated with subnormal activity of the sphincters and may be a cause of rectal prolapse. It can be treated successfully by anterior rectosigmoid resection. Incontinent constipation will also require operative approximation of the levators in many cases. Improvement cannot be expected to result from this procedure, however, unless the pelvic floor shows some residual resting activity.']",['ger'],"['Abdominal Muscles/innervation', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cesarean Section', 'Fecal Incontinence/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle Denervation', 'Muscle Hypotonia/physiopathology', 'Muscle Tonus/physiology', 'Muscular Atrophy/physiopathology', 'Neuromuscular Junction/physiopathology', 'Peritoneal Cavity/innervation', 'Pregnancy/physiology']",

Since epithelial cells derived from the toad bladder also contain this enzyme, we wished to further characterize its properties in prepared cell homogenates. 11 beta-OHSD from toad bladder demonstrated a clear preference for NAD+ over NADP+ as a cofactor similar to that observed in renal cortical collecting duct (CCD) cells.

The end product, 11-dehydrocorticosterone (compound A), influenced enzyme activity; it increased 11 beta-OHSD activity at corticosterone concentrations below the apparent Km for the enzyme and inhibited 11 beta-OHSD activity at corticosterone concentrations above the Km for the enzyme. The inhibitory effects of compound A appeared noncompetitive with an apparent equilibrium constant (Ki) of 2.8 x 10(-7) M.

The rigid acrylic resin of the prosthesis maintains the patency of the tracheostoma or tracheostoma fistula while a resilient material in the peristomal area reduces the pressure and potential irritation.

All the arginine mutants displayed severely or completely impeded photosynthetic growth resulting from dysfunctional cyt bc1 complexes.

It is located in the vicinity of residues altered in spontaneous inhibitor resistant mutants that affect the ubihydroquinone oxidase (Qo) site of this enzyme. In this work, Y147 was substituted with phenylalanine (F), valine (V), serine (S), and alanine (A) using site-directed mutagenesis in an effort to investigate its specific role in the Qo site. Of the four mutants obtained, Y147S and Y147A exhibited very low ubihydroquinone:cyt c reductase activities and were unable to support photosynthetic growth (Ps) while Y147F and Y147V were Ps+. In all mutants, no changes in the redox midpoint potentials (Em7) of the cyt bH and cyt bL, the occupancy of the Qo site by Q/QH2, and the flash-induced reverse electron transfer kinetics from Qi to cyt bH were observed. On the other hand, rates of electron transfer from Qo to cyt bH were mildly reduced (2-3-fold) in Y147F and V but dramatically decreased (about 20-fold) in Y147A and S, localizing the defect to the Qo site. Thus, Y147A and S are members of a novel class of Qo site mutants that affect the Qo site catalysis without perturbing the accessibility or binding of the substrate. Additional insight to the role of Y147 on ubihydroquinone oxidation was gained by analyzing the Ps+ revertants of these mutants.

Two isoforms exist: 11 beta-HSD1, a bidirectional NADPH-dependent enzyme, and 11 beta-HSD2, an NAD(+)-dependent exclusive 11 beta-dehydrogenase (corticosterone-inactivating enzyme). In this study, 11 beta-HSD1 activity and mRNA synthesis were demonstrated in primary fetal hippocampal cell cultures. Unexpectedly, the reaction direction in intact hippocampal cells was 11 beta-reduction (reactivation of inert 11-dehydrocorticosterone), although homogenization revealed that the enzyme was capable of 11 beta-dehydrogenation when removed from its normal cellular context. Dexamethasone (10(-7) M) increased 11 beta-HSD activity in homogenates of hippocampal cultures (102% increase). In intact hippocampal cells, dexamethasone induced 11 beta reductase, not dehydrogenase. To determine the functional relevance of hippocampal 11 beta-reductase, glucocorticoid potentiation of kainic acid neurotoxicity was examined. Pretreatment of hippocampal cells with corticosterone reduced survival on kainate exposure. Hippocampal cell 11 beta-HSD activity was potently inhibited by carbenoxolone. Carbenoxolone had no effect on cell survival after kainate alone and did not alter the effect of corticosterone. 11-Dehydrocorticosterone also potentiated kainate neurotoxicity; this effect was lost, however, if 11 beta-HSD was inhibited with carbenoxolone. Thus, hippocampal 11 beta-HSD seems to be a functional 11 beta-reductase in intact cells. Measures to attenuate hippocampal 11 beta-reductase may reduce neuronal vulnerability to glucocorticoid toxicity.']",['eng'],"['11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured/enzymology', 'Corticosterone/analogs & derivatives', 'Corticosterone/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Hippocampus/cytology', 'Hippocampus/enzymology', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/metabolism', 'Kainic Acid/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neurons/cytology', 'Neurons/enzymology', 'Neurotoxins/metabolism', 'Rats']","['Glucocorticoids', 'Neurotoxins', 'Dexamethasone (7S5I7G3JQL)', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.-)', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.146)', '11-dehydrocorticosterone (FO4V44A3G3)', 'Kainic Acid (SIV03811UC)', 'Corticosterone (W980KJ009P)']"

In contrast, picornavirus and some specialized mRNAS initiate translation by internally binding ribosomes. A poorly described third mechanism of initiation, referred to as ribosome shunting or jumping, involves discontinuous scanning by 40S ribosome subunits, in which large segments of the 5' noncoding region are bypassed. Ribosome shunting has only been observed to date on a cauliflower mosaic virus mRNA. In this report we show that the family of adenovirus late mRNAs, which are preferentially translated during infection, use a ribosome jumping mechanism to initiate protein synthesis. Late adenovirus mRNAs contain a common 5'-noncoding region known as the tripartite leader, which confers preferential translation by reducing the requirement for the rate-limiting initiation factor eIF-4F (cap-binding protein complex). Adenovirus inhibits cell protein synthesis largely by inactivating eIF-4F. We show that the tripartite leader directs both 5' linear ribosome scanning and ribosome jumping when eIF-4F is abundant but exclusively uses a ribosome jumping mechanism during late adenovirus infection or heat shock (stress) of mammalian cells, when eIF-4F is altered or inactivated. Shunting is directed by a complex group of secondary structures in the tripartite leader and is facilitated by one or more unidentified viral late gene products. We propose that shunting may represent a widespread mechanism to facilitate selective translation of specialized classes of capped mRNAs, including some stress and developmentally regulated mRNAs, which possess little requirement for eIF-4F but do not initiate by internal ribosome binding.""]",['eng'],"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line/virology', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F', 'Genes, Viral', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational', 'Peptide Initiation Factors/genetics', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Ribosomes/genetics', 'Viral Structural Proteins/genetics']","['Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F', 'Peptide Initiation Factors', 'Viral Structural Proteins']"

Today, dentists bond materials not only to enamel, but also to dentine. Up until recently, the clinical success with dentine bonding agents had been unreliable at best, and many clinicians had become sceptical as to whether it would ever be possible to bond to dentine. In this paper, some of the important break-throughs in the field of dentinal adhesives are reviewed in an attempt to throw some light on the question, does resin based dentine bonding work? The technical procedure used to optimise dentine bonding is reviewed, emphasising the significance of etching dentine, placing the primer on a slightly moist dentine surface, avoiding oxygen inhibition of the bonding resin, and maximising the degree of cure. In addition, emphasis is also placed on the significance of variations in dentine structure, and how sclerotic dentine may make dentine bonding less efficient. The conclusion of the entire review is that although significant improvements have been made in the field of dentine bonding during the last few years, it is still too early to conclude that dentine bonding will survive several years of clinical service.']",['eng'],"['Acid Etching, Dental', 'Adhesives/chemistry', 'Calcinosis/pathology', 'Dental Bonding', 'Dental Enamel/ultrastructure', 'Dentin/ultrastructure', 'Dentin, Secondary/pathology', 'Dentin-Bonding Agents/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Resins, Synthetic/chemistry']","['Adhesives', 'Dentin-Bonding Agents', 'Resins, Synthetic']"

UDCA made up 63% of the total serum bile acids in compensated liver cirrhosis and 61% in chronic active hepatitis after UDCA treatment. Of the serum bile acids after UDCA treatment, 35.2 and 53.9% of UDCA was sulfate conjugated in compensated liver cirrhosis and chronic active hepatitis, respectively. Urinary excretion of total bile acid and UDCA after UDCA treatment in compensated liver cirrhosis were higher than in chronic active hepatitis. UDCA made up 68% of the total urinary bile acids in compensated liver cirrhosis and 64% in chronic active hepatitis after UDCA treatment. Of the urinary bile acids after UDCA treatment, 51.8 and 54.8% of UDCA was sulfate conjugated in compensated liver cirrhosis and chronic active hepatitis, respectively. UDCA treatment for compensated liver cirrhosis was less effective than for chronic active hepatitis. We found that sulfate conjugation is one of the major metabolic pathways for UDCA after UDCA treatment in chronic liver diseases.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bile Acids and Salts/blood', 'Bile Acids and Salts/urine', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liver/physiopathology', 'Liver Diseases/drug therapy', 'Liver Diseases/metabolism', 'Liver Diseases/physiopathology', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sulfates', 'Ursodeoxycholic Acid/metabolism', 'Ursodeoxycholic Acid/therapeutic use']","['Bile Acids and Salts', 'Sulfates', 'Ursodeoxycholic Acid (724L30Y2QR)']"

The binocular instability was best identified by measuring the vergence amplitude: a modified Dunlop test failed to differentiate reliably between the two groups. Here, we report a significant correlation between flicker threshold and binocular instability, thus linking sensory and motor visual correlates of dyslexia. We also present further new analyses on the interaction between optometric variables and the psychometric measurement of coding skills.

Since polysomnography (PSG) only provides one sleep onset with which to assess a patient's estimation, we investigated the use of the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) for this purpose. Among 147 patients who had an MSLT, 137 of whom had a preceding PSG, overestimation of sleep latency occurred on 78% and 74% of the respective tests. The magnitude of overestimation averaged 3 minutes and 27 minutes, respectively, and was not dependent on diagnosis. Subjects who had reported a history of difficulty falling asleep, compared to those who did not, tended to show equivalent objective sleep latencies, longer subjective nocturnal sleep latencies and less overall accuracy in their estimates. Those who denied having a problem with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) showed objective sleep latencies nearly identical to those who complained of EDS but had only a trend toward higher overestimation on the MSLT. Overestimation of sleep latency is therefore more readily part of an explanation for why hypersomnolent patients sometimes complain of insomnia than it is for failure to recognize EDS. The MSLT as well as nocturnal recordings can provide data with which to assess overestimation of sleep latency.""]",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Narcolepsy/diagnosis', 'Polysomnography', 'Sex Factors', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes/diagnosis', 'Time Factors']",

Results revealed statistically significant (p < 0.01) within group improvement in PI, GI, and BI for both treatment groups over time. No statistically significant between group differences were found for either group at any time period. In addition, no significant gingival trauma was recorded and no differences were found between groups. Quik Floss was as effective as finger flossing.

These are caused by a decrease of bone mass and deterioration of bone structure leading to loss of strength. Treatment of osteoporosis should result in an increase of bone mass, and the incidence of new vertebral fractures should diminish. However, new vertebral fractures are not always accompanied by pain, and disability does not well correlate with the number of vertebral fractures. Patients with osteoporosis often have other problems e.g. with taking a shower, preparing meals, gardening, walking stairs, visiting friends and attending social activities. In addition, pain and disability may influence mood and lead to depression. The assessment of quality of life should be a primary endpoint in clinical trials in patients with osteoporosis and in individual patients care. Recently, the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (EFFO) has decided a develop a questionnaire for patients with vertebral osteoporosis, i.e. patients with vertebral deformities. The questionnaire is meant for use in clinical trials. A questionnaire was made including 48 questions and 6 visual analogue scales. The questions concern the following domains: pain, activities of daily living, jobs around the house, moving, leisure and social activities, general health perception and mood.

Because environmental or caretaking factors have been shown to exert powerful effects on susceptibility to SIDS, manipulations that facilitate arousability might be protective against SIDS. All-night laboratory polysomnographic recordings were performed in 20 routinely bedsharing and 15 routinely solitary sleeping healthy breast-feeding Latino infants within the peak age range for SIDS, in both bedsharing (with mother) and solitary sleeping environments. The most important findings revealed by repeated measures analyses of variance were a significant reduction in stage 3/4 sleep and an inverse increase in stage 1/2 sleep on the bedsharing night compared to the solitary night, irrespective of routine sleeping arrangement. Shorter mean duration episodes of stage 3/4 sleep and longer mean stage 1/2 sleep episodes accounted for these differences. Because the arousal threshold is high in the electroencephalographic delta range, by limiting the amount of stage 3/4 sleep, bedsharing should promote infant arousability and might be protective against SIDS. The results also suggest that accepted normative values for infant sleep established in solitary sleeping infants may not be representative of infants raised in social sleeping environments.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Arousal/physiology', 'Beds', 'Humans', 'Infant Care', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Mother-Child Relations', 'Polysomnography', 'Posture/physiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sleep Stages/physiology', 'Sleep, REM/physiology', 'Sudden Infant Death/etiology']",

Six routinely bedsharing and six routinely solitary-sleeping pairs slept 3 nights in the sleep laboratory. The first night matched the routine home condition, followed by 1 bedsharing night and 1 solitary-sleeping night in random order. During bedsharing infants were never placed prone, regardless of their routine sleeping condition. On the bedsharing night, mothers and infants spent most of the night oriented toward each other; seven of 12 infants remained oriented toward their mothers the entire night. While sleeping in a face-to-face orientation, most pairs slept most of the time less than 30 cm apart with appreciable amounts of time at less than 20 cm. This orientation and proximity should facilitate sensory exchanges between mother and infant which, we hypothesize, influence the infant's sleep physiology and nocturnal behavior. We conclude that bedsharing minimizes the use of the prone infant sleeping position, probably in part to facilitate breast feeding. By promoting nonprone positions, bedsharing may protect some infants from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), since prone sleeping is a known risk factor for SIDS. The large percentage of the night that mothers spent oriented toward their infants suggests that a higher degree of maternal vigilance may also result from bedsharing.""]",['eng'],"['Breast Feeding', 'California', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Care', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Mother-Child Relations', 'Orientation', 'Posture/physiology', 'Prone Position/physiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sleep/physiology', 'Sudden Infant Death/prevention & control', 'United States']",

A belief that bedsharing with infants negatively impacts the quality of adult sleep also appears wide-spread. This has not been substantiated, however, because the few studies that have measured the impact of bedsharing on adult sleep examined only bedsharing with another adult. In the present study, laboratory polysomnography was performed in 20 routinely bedsharing and 15 routinely solitary-sleeping, breastfeeding, Latino mother-infant pairs comparing the mothers' sleep when bedsharing to solitary-sleeping nights. Infants were 11-15 weeks old at the time. Irrespective of routine sleeping arrangement, mothers' total sleep time was not decreased on the bedsharing night compared to the solitary night. Across the two groups, percent Stage 3-4 sleep (of total sleep time) was significantly reduced on the bedsharing night but only by 3.9%, while Stage 1-2 sleep was increased 3.7%. Episodes of both Stages 3-4 and 1-2 were significantly shorter. The amount of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was unaffected. Overall, arousal frequency was significantly increased by 3.6 hour-1. As the increase in arousal frequency was stage specific, it could account for the pattern of stage changes. Nocturnal wakefulness was not increased, however, because awakenings were of shorter duration. these effects of bedsharing did not habituate with routine bedsharing because they were not diminished in the routinely bedsharing mothers compared to the routinely solitary-sleeping mothers. We find that the impact of bedsharing on maternal sleep is modest and somewhat different from the reported impact of sleeping with another adult. From the infant's standpoint, the effects on maternal sleep are adaptive to the extent that opportunities to monitor the infant's status are enhanced. The mother's caregiver role is likely germane to differential effects on sleep of bedsharing with an infant versus another adult.""]",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Arousal', 'Beds', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mother-Child Relations', 'Mothers', 'Sleep Stages', 'Sleep, REM']",

For each pair, an adaptation night was followed by one night each of bedsharing and solitary sleeping.!##!Results!#!The most important finding is that when tested in their usual sleeping conditions, routinely bedsharing infants breastfed approximately three times longer during the night than infants who routinely slept separately: this reflected a two-fold increase in the number of breastfeeding episodes and 39% longer episodes. Breastfeeding was also facilitated on the bedsharing night relative to the solitary night within the routinely bedsharing group: the number and total duration of breastfeeding episodes were significantly larger on the bedsharing night.!##!Conclusions!#!We suggest that, by increasing breastfeeding, bedsharing might be protective against SIDS, at least in some contexts. Furthermore, maternal reproductive physiology could be impacted because nursing frequency affects ovulation. This is the first study to directly measure nocturnal breastfeeding behavior in any cultural group.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Beds', 'Breast Feeding/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lactation/physiology', 'Male', 'Sleep']",

M9261495,['Maternal proximity and infant CO2 environment during bedsharing and possible implications for SIDS research.'],"[""Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the leading cause of human infant mortality after the neonatal period in Western countries. Recently, child care practices have been shown to be important in determining infant vulnerability to SIDS. However, very little is known about the impact of parent-infant cosleeping on infant sleep physiology and behavior and SIDS risk. This reflects the failure of Western societal research paradigms to appreciate the human infant's evolutionary history of cosleeping, the recency of the emergence of solitary infant sleeping as a practice and the fact that parent-infant cosleeping is still the preferred sleeping arrangement for the majority of contemporary societies. Incorporating current hypotheses on the mechanisms of SIDS, we have hypothesized that the comparatively sensory-rich cosleeping environment might be protective against SIDS in some contexts. As a first step to characterize cosleeping environments, this investigation is aimed at assessing, in routinely bedsharing mothers and infants, their relative sleeping positions and the potential for sleeping in close face-to face proximity and for infant exposure to increased environmental CO2 produced by maternal respiration. The latter is important in that breathing elevated levels of CO2 can have diverse effects, ranging from respiratory stimulation at low levels to suffocation at very high levels. Two related laboratory studies were performed. In the first, all-night videotapes of 12 healthy, routinely bedsharing mother-infant pairs were analyzed for sleeping positions and time spent in face-to-face orientation and distances separating their faces. Infants were 11-15 wk old. Mothers predominantly positioned themselves on their sides facing their infants, with the infants placed either supine or on their sides. Mothers and infants slept oriented face-to-face for 64 +/- 27% (S.D.) of non-movement time, with distance less than 20 cm commonly separating their faces. In the second study, concentrations of CO2 in air were measured in six young women at distances of up to 21 cm from their nares. Peak expiratory CO2 concentrations remained above 1.0% at distances up to 9 cm and above 0.5% at 18 cm. Both baseline and peak CO2 levels were further increased at all distances when measured within a partial air pocket created to simulate a bedding environment sometimes seen during bedsharing. We conclude that during bedsharing there is potential for 1) a high degree of face-to-face orientation and close proximity and consequently 2) increased environmental CO2, as a result of maternal respiration, to non-lethal levels that might stimulate infant respiration. The close proximity would also maximize the sensory impact of the mother on the infant through other modalities. We also suggest that bedsharing may minimize prone infant positioning, a known risk factor for SIDS.""]",['eng'],"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Breast Feeding', 'California', 'Carbon Dioxide/analysis', 'Carbon Dioxide/metabolism', 'Environment', 'Female', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Posture/physiology', 'Research', 'Respiration/physiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sleep/physiology', 'Sudden Infant Death/epidemiology', 'Sudden Infant Death/etiology', 'Videotape Recording']",['Carbon Dioxide (142M471B3J)']

A standardized test evaluated resident pediatric critical care knowledge before and after the pediatric ICU rotation. Number and type of resident procedures were documented. Four-point Likert scale questionnaires were used to evaluate resident educational satisfaction and resident performance. Opportunity cost, the graduate medical education return on educational investment, the critical care attending physician\'s return on resident investment, and the optimal teaching time for number of rotation residents were calculated. Unit demographics were documented. Data analysis included multivariate analysis, t-test, and chi-squared techniques. Significance was defined as p < .05, rotated factor loading > 0.5, and Eigenvalues > or = 1. Kmeans identified clusters. From September 1994 to May 1996, 71 residents, 34 (48%) from pediatric or medicine-pediatric programs and 37 (52%) from emergency medicine residency programs, participated in our second-year pediatric ICU resident educational process. All residents showed improvement between pretest and posttest knowledge scores (p < .05). Seventy percent of the variance in critical care attending physician evaluations of the residents during their pediatric ICU rotation was based on bedside clinical skills (31%), communication skills (20%), and basic knowledge base (19%). Critical care attending physician evaluations of residents placed residents into three clusters: ""hands-on,"" ""well-rounded,"" or ""book-heavy"" residents. Prerotation test scores, postrotation test scores, and numbers of procedures performed did not correlate with how critical care attending physicians evaluated overall performances of individual residents. Three factors explained 61% of the variances in resident satisfaction with the pediatric ICU rotation: clinical experience (27%), formal didactics (18%), and text availability (16%). Resident educational satisfaction did not appear to depend on access to procedures. Critical care attending physicians spent a minimum of 12.6 hrs/wk involved in resident education. The opportunity cost for using critical care attending physicians to provide 12.6 resident teaching hours per week was calculated as $111,384/yr. Pediatric ICU patient demographics, morbidity, and mortality did not change during the introduction of the resident educational program in the pediatric ICU.!##!Conclusions!#!During a required pediatric ICU resident rotation, balancing the resident\'s educational and decision-making autonomy needs and the critical care attending physician\'s desire to provide consistent bedside care of the critically ill child is an ongoing interactive process that requires substantial personnel, time, and financial commitments. It is possible to maintain patient care in the pediatric ICU and provide residents with a satisfying pediatric ICU experience. Trends in financial reimbursement may limit our present time commitment to the resident pediatric ICU curriculum.']",['eng'],"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness/therapy', 'Curriculum', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intensive Care Units, Pediatric', 'Internship and Residency/economics', 'Pediatrics/education']",

We have tested the hypothesis of whether the infants who had received NIDCAP would show advanced sleep-wake pattern, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental outcome.!##!Methods!#!Thirty-five VLBW infants were randomly assigned to receive NIDCAP or routine infant care. The goals for NIDCAP intervention were to enhance comfort and stability and to reduce stress and agitation for the preterm infants by: a) altering the environment by decreasing excess light and noise in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and by using covers over the incubators and cribs; b) use of positioning aids such as boundary supports, nests, and buntings to promote a balance of flexion and extension postures; c) modification of direct hands-on caregiving to maximize preparation of infants for, tolerance of, and facilitation of recovery from interventions; d) promotion of self-regulatory behaviors such as holding on, grasping, and sucking; e) attention to the readiness for and the ability to take oral feedings; and f) involving parents in the care of their infants as much as possible. The infants' sleep was recorded at 36 weeks postconceptional age (PCA) and at 3 months corrected age (CA) using the Motility Monitoring System (MMS), an automated, nonintrusive procedure for determining sleep state from movement and respiration patterns. Behavioral and developmental outcome was assessed by the Neurobehavioral Assessment of the Preterm Infant (NAPI) at 36 weeks PCA, the APIB at 42 weeks PCA, and by the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) at 4, 12, and 24 months CA.!##!Results!#!Sleep developmental measures at 3 months CA showed a clear developmental change compared with 36 weeks PCA. These include: increased amount of quiet sleep, reduced active sleep and indeterminate sleep, decreased arousal, and transitions during sleep. Longest sleep period at night showed a clear developmental effect (increased) when comparing nighttime sleep pattern of infants at 3 months with those at 36 weeks of age. Day-night rhythm of sleep-wake increased significantly from 36 weeks PCA to 3 months CA. However, neither of these sleep developmental changes showed any significant effects of NIDCAP intervention. Although all APIB measures showed better organized behavior in NIDCAP patients, neither NAPI nor Bayley showed any developmental advantages for the intervention group. The neurodevelopmental outcome measured by the Bayley at 4, 12, and 24 months CA showed 64% of the NIDCAP intervention group at the lowest possible score compared with 33% of the control group. These findings could not be explained by the occurrence of intraventricular hemorrhage or the socioeconomic status of the parents, which showed no significant group effect.!##!Conclusion!#!The results of this study, including measures of sleep maturation and neurodevelopmental outcome up to 2 years of age did not demonstrate that the NIDCAP intervention results in increased maturity or development. Buehler et al (Pediatrics. 1995;96:923-932) have reported that premature infants (N = 12; mean gestational age 32 weeks, mean birth weight 1700 g) who received developmental care compared with a similar group of infants who received routine care showed better organized behavioral performance on an APIB assessment at 42 weeks PCA. None of the medical outcome measures were significantly different in this study. Although our APIB results are in agreement, the results of the NAPI, the Bayley and sleep measures do not show an increase in neurodevelopmental maturation.

In the present study, 11betaHSD activity was compared in the intestine of herbivorous (guinea pig), omnivorous (rat), and granivorous (hen) animals, i.e., in animals in which the Na+ transport either is or is not regulated by aldosterone under normal conditions and in which the plasma levels of individual glucocorticoids are different. Slices of various intestinal segments were incubated in the presence of corticosterone or 11-dehydrocorticosterone, and the steroids were extracted and analyzed by HPLC. In the mammalian intestine, the activity of 11betaHSD was very low (approaching zero) in aldosterone-insensitive segments (duodenum, jejunum) but significant activity was revealed in aldosterone-sensitive segments (ileum, cecum, and proximal and distal colon). In comparison with the rat, the guinea pig large intestine exhibited significantly higher activity of 11betaHSD. There was no detectable reductase activity (conversion of 11-dehydrocorticosterone to corticosterone) in any intestinal segments of either species. Unexpectedly, no 11betaHSD activity was observed in the avian intestine. It was found that, in contrast to the mammalian intestine, corticosterone was metabolized to 20-dihydrocorticosterone while 11-dehydrocorticosterone was converted to 11-dehydro-20-dihydrocorticosterone. The distribution of 20-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20HSD) activity in the avian intestine was homogenous along the intestine and did not correlate with the mineralocorticoid sensitivity of intestinal segments. To trace different cosubstrate dependence of 11betaHSD and 20HSD, homogenates of ileum and distal colon were incubated with NAD+/NADH or NADP+/NADPH, respectively. In accordance with slice experiments mammalian intestine displayed only oxidation of corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone and NAD+ preference. In avian intestine, the metabolite formed from corticosterone was 11-dehydrocorticosterone in the presence of NAD+ or NADP+ whereas in the presence of NADPH 11-dehydro-20-dihydrocorticosterone and 20-dihydrocorticosterone were formed. Given the wide similarity between mineralocorticoid regulation of epithelial transport in mammals and birds, the unexpected finding of differences in the metabolism of corticosterone suggests that role of 20HSD is to allow aldosterone occupancy of mineralocorticoid receptors.']",['eng'],"['11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases', 'Animals', 'Biotransformation', 'Chickens', 'Corticosterone/analogs & derivatives', 'Corticosterone/metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/enzymology', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Female', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/metabolism', 'Intestinal Mucosa/enzymology', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Species Specificity', 'Subcellular Fractions/enzymology', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism']","['Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.-)', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.146)', '11-dehydrocorticosterone (FO4V44A3G3)', 'Corticosterone (W980KJ009P)']"

From the review of the literature it can be concluded that the mechanisms of bonding to dentine are still not fully understood. The more recently introduced materials use mechanical means of adhesion where the dentine is altered by primers or conditioners to expose collagen fibres and a hybrid zone is created by the penetration of unfilled resins into this fibrous network. The irritant effects of a bonding agent on pulpal tissue may be caused by bacterial ingrowth due to initial poor bonding or a breakdown of the bond in addition to any inherent toxicity of the constituents of the bonding agent.']",['eng'],"['Bicuspid/drug effects', 'Bicuspid/ultrastructure', 'Biocompatible Materials/pharmacology', 'Dental Bonding', 'Dental Restoration, Permanent/methods', 'Dentin/drug effects', 'Dentin/ultrastructure', 'Dentin-Bonding Agents/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Smear Layer']","['Biocompatible Materials', 'Dentin-Bonding Agents']"

Data from a survey of 41142, 12-16-year-old children from 244 secondary schools throughout England were analysed to obtain information about flossing frequency, dental attendance and recalled advice about flossing, and some general cleanliness and social behaviours. Subjects completed a questionnaire, anonymously, in class during normal school hours. Flossing frequency was found to change with age, its use becoming less frequent from age 12 through age 16 years. There was a significant relationship between flossing frequency and the time since the last dental attendance, the more recent attenders flossing more frequently. 6% of subjects recalled receiving advice about flossing at their last dental attendance and higher proportions of those who used floss recalled such advice, compared with non-flossers. Flossing frequency was also found to correlate positively with frequencies of washing hands after visiting the lavatory and bathing, and having a current friend of the opposite gender. There was only a small association between smoking habit and flossing, and only in school years 8 and 10: subjects most committed to smoking used floss slightly more frequently than those who did not smoke. Factor analysis showed evidence of gender differences in perceptions of flossing. Males equated use of floss with health-related behaviours while females associated flossing more with cleanliness behaviours. This finding is consistent with gender differences in toothbrushing behaviour reported in previous studies. The present study provides further insights into the history of dental flossing.']",['eng'],"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Baths/statistics & numerical data', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Dental Care/statistics & numerical data', 'Dental Devices, Home Care/statistics & numerical data', 'England', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Female', 'Hand Disinfection', 'Health Behavior', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oral Hygiene/instrumentation', 'Oral Hygiene/psychology', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Behavior', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",

The forum provided an assessment of the evidence for recommendations to reduce the risk of SIDS using an evidence-based process. Strong evidence has now accumulated that the intervention campaigns to reduce prone sleeping during infancy have been followed by SIDS rate declines. Recent data indicate that the supine position is not associated with an increase in significant morbidity outcomes and provides greater protection for SIDS than the side position, which may be unstable. Covering of the baby's head by bedding is strongly related to SIDS. The infant's sleeping environment should be carefully set up to ensure that the baby's head, including the face, cannot be obstructed during sleep. Parental smoking is strongly associated with SIDS. Structural supportive interventions for parental smoking cessation are required. Bedsharing increases the risk of SIDS amongst smokers and the data are currently not sufficient to provide complete reassurance to nonsmoking parents that bedsharing is safe. Infants should be maintained in a comfortable temperature zone. The evidence for a protective effect of breast-feeding is conflicting, so breast-feeding cannot be promoted strongly as reducing the risk of SIDS. Immunisation has not been associated with SIDS. Parents and carers should be aware of the current guidelines. Health professionals should also be aware of the evidence on which the current recommendations are based. Effective health education programmes should lead to a further decline in SIDS mortality in Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Australia', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Risk Factors', 'Sudden Infant Death/etiology', 'Sudden Infant Death/prevention & control']",

Most elders were using a wide array of community-based services and extensive informal support networks prior to entering the nursing home. Most described specific events that forced them into the nursing home environment. Health needs, specifically the need for 24-hour care or supervision, emerged as the dominant factor for remaining in the nursing home. Of the 12 elders interviewed, all demonstrated some evidence of cognitive impairment.

The presence or absence of the Qi inhibitor antimycin A did not affect the binding of the Qo inhibitors. Different subtypes of Qo inhibitors had dramatically different effects on the mobility of the extramembrane domain of the iron-sulfur protein (ISP): Binding of 5-undecyl-6-hydroxy-4, 7-dioxobenzothiazol and stigmatellin (subtype Qo-II and Qo-III, respectively) led to a fixation of the ISP domain on the surface of cytochrome b, whereas binding of myxothiazol and methoxyacrylate-stilbene (subtype Qo-I) favored release of this domain. The native structure has an empty Qo pocket and is intermediate between these extremes. On the basis of these observations we propose a model of quinone oxidation in the bc1 complex, which incorporates fixed and loose states of the ISP as features important for electron transfer and, possibly, also proton transport.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cattle', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Electron Transport Complex III/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Electron Transport Complex III/chemistry', 'Electron Transport Complex III/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins/chemistry', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondria, Heart/metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'Ubiquinone/chemistry']","['Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins', 'Ubiquinone (1339-63-5)', 'Electron Transport Complex III (EC 1.10.2.2)']"

We studied the clinicopathologic features of 54 cases of PNF for which the hematoxylin- and eosin-stained slides and paraffin blocks were available and adequate clinical follow-up could be obtained. In addition, in all cases, a representative section of the PNF and, when present, MPNST, was evaluated immunohistochemically with an antibody for p53 (DO7). The cohort included 28 male patients and 26 female patients, with an age range from 4 to 79 years (mean, 27 yr). Of these 54 patients, 46 (85%) met the strict diagnostic criteria for NF1. Thirty-nine patients had PNF alone; 15 patients had an MPNST arising from the PNF (PNF/MPNST). Those patients with PNF/MPNST tended to be older (38 yr vs. 22 yr) and to have larger tumors (10.5 cm mean vs. 7.4 cm mean) than those with PNF alone. In 9 patients (23%) of 39 with PNF alone, local recurrence developed, whereas in 7 patients (47%) of 15 with PNF/MPNST, recurrent MPNST developed, and metastases developed in 3 (20%) of the 15. Immunohistochemically, only 1 case (2.5%) of 39 cases of PNF alone stained for p53. On the other hand, 12 (80%) of 15 cases of PNF/MPNST showed p53 immunoreactivity in the MPNST component, 2 of which also showed staining in the PNF areas. In conclusion, we found that the vast majority of patients with PNF met the strict diagnostic criteria for NF1. The immunohistochemical detection of intranuclear p53 protein is common in the malignant areas of PNF/MPNST but is rare in the PNF regions. The rarity of p53 staining in the PNF regions precludes its use in predicting those tumors that are likely to progress to MPNST.']",['eng'],"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nerve Sheath Neoplasms/chemistry', 'Nerve Sheath Neoplasms/complications', 'Nerve Sheath Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Nerve Sheath Neoplasms/pathology', 'Neurofibroma, Plexiform/chemistry', 'Neurofibroma, Plexiform/complications', 'Neurofibroma, Plexiform/epidemiology', 'Neurofibroma, Plexiform/pathology', 'Peripheral Nervous System Neoplasms/chemistry', 'Peripheral Nervous System Neoplasms/complications', 'Peripheral Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Peripheral Nervous System Neoplasms/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis']",['Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']

It has already been reported that beef heart submitochondrial particles under such conditions exhibit an EPR-detectable semiquinone, which is distinct from Q-i and which was attributed to a semiquinone in the Qo site (de Vries, S., Albracht, S. P. J., Berden, J. A., and Slater, E. C. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 11996-11998). However, we show here that this signal, which can be generated to a level of around 0.1 per bc1 monomer, is insensitive to the Qo site inhibitors myxothiazol, E-beta-methoxyacrylate-stilbene, and stigmatellin, indicating that it does not arise from a Q-o species. Based on sensitivities to inhibitors of other Q sites, up to 60% of the signal may arise from semiquinones of complexes I and II. We further show that the iron-sulfur center remains EPR silent under oxidant-induced reduction conditions. Overall, the results indicate that, under conditions of oxidant-induced reduction, the Qo site is occupied primarily by quinol with the iron-sulfur center oxidized, or, possibly, by an antiferromagnetically coupled semiquinone/reduced iron-sulfur center pair, which are EPR silent. This is discussed in relation to proposed mechanisms of quinol oxidation in the Qo site, and we describe a minimal intermediate-controlled bifurcation model based on rate constants by which bifurcated electron transfer at the Qo site might occur.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Antimycin A/pharmacology', 'Benzoquinones/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Electron Transport Complex III/metabolism', 'Hydroquinones/metabolism', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondria, Heart/metabolism', 'Models, Chemical', 'Oxidation-Reduction']","['Benzoquinones', 'Hydroquinones', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins', 'semiquinone radicals (3225-29-4)', 'Antimycin A (642-15-9)', 'Electron Transport Complex III (EC 1.10.2.2)']"

Although the suppressive effects of UDCA on some cytokine productions, T-cell mediated cytotoxicity and immunoglobulin production were observed from in vitro studies, the immunomodulation in vivo by UDCA remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effect of UDCA administration on the number of immunoglobulin secreting cells in liver, peripheral blood, spleen and Peyer's patches in mice using the enzyme linked immunospot assay and assessed whether the UDCA-mediated immunomodulation is liver-specific. It was demonstrated that intragastric administration of UDCA reduced immunoglobulin secretion by lymphocytes from liver, but not from peripheral blood, spleen, or Peyer's patches. However, immunoglobulin production of those lymphocytes cultured in the presence of UDCA was suppressed, irrespective of their distribution sites, in a UDCA dose-dependent manner. When the concentrations of UDCA in portal and peripheral blood were measured using high performance liquid chromatography, UDCA was detectable in the portal blood in UDCA-treated mice, but not in peripheral blood, suggesting that the concentrations of UDCA in the environment surrounding lymphocytes may be an important factor for the modulation of lymphocyte functions.""]",['eng'],"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/blood', 'Adjuvants, Immunologic/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Immunoglobulins/biosynthesis', 'Liver/cytology', 'Liver/drug effects', 'Liver/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', ""Peyer's Patches/cytology"", ""Peyer's Patches/drug effects"", ""Peyer's Patches/immunology"", 'Spleen/cytology', 'Spleen/drug effects', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Ursodeoxycholic Acid/blood', 'Ursodeoxycholic Acid/pharmacology']","['Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Ursodeoxycholic Acid (724L30Y2QR)']"

In tissue homogenates, 11beta-HSD type 1 (11beta-HSD-1) exhibits both 11beta-dehydrogenase (corticosterone inactivating) and 11beta-reductase (corticosterone regenerating) activities, whereas 11beta-HSD type 2 (11beta-HSD-2) is an exclusive dehydrogenase. In the rat testis, 11beta-HSD has been proposed to reduce glucocorticoid inhibition of testosterone production, promoting puberty and fertility. This hypothesis presupposes dehydrogenation predominates. 11beta-HSD-1 immunoreactivity has been localised to Leydig cells. However, recent studies suggest that 11beta-HSD-1 is predominantly an 11beta-reductase in many intact cells. We therefore examined the expression and reaction direction of 11beta-HSD isozymes in cultures of intact rat Leydig cells. Reverse transcriptase PCR demonstrated expression of 11beta-HSD-1, but not 11beta-HSD-2 mRNA in rat testis. Primary cultures of intact rat Leydig cells showed predominant 11beta-reductase activity, activating 50-70% of 11-dehydrocorticosterone to corticosterone over 3 h, whereas 11beta-dehydrogenation was <5%. Although both dexamethasone (10 nM) and corticosterone (1 microM) modestly inhibited LH-stimulated testosterone production by Leydig cells, inert 11-dehydrocorticosterone (1 microM) had similar effects, suggesting 11beta-reductase is functionally important. Carbenoxolone (10(-5) M) inhibited 11beta-reduction in intact Leydig cells. However, although carbenoxolone reduced Leydig cell testosterone production, this also occurred in the absence of glucocorticoids, suggesting effects distinct from modulation of corticosteroid access to Leydig cells. In conclusion, rat Leydig cell 11beta-HSD-1 is unlikely to reduce glucocorticoid access to testicular receptors. More likely, 11beta-reductase amplifies glucocorticoid action, perhaps to maintain Leydig cell metabolic and endocrine functions.']",['eng'],"['11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases', 'Animals', 'Carbenoxolone/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Corticosterone/analogs & derivatives', 'Corticosterone/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/genetics', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/metabolism', 'Kidney/enzymology', 'Leydig Cells/enzymology', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Luteinizing Hormone/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Testis/drug effects', 'Testis/enzymology', 'Testosterone/biosynthesis']","['Glucocorticoids', 'Testosterone (3XMK78S47O)', 'Dexamethasone (7S5I7G3JQL)', 'Luteinizing Hormone (9002-67-9)', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.-)', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.146)', '11-dehydrocorticosterone (FO4V44A3G3)', 'Carbenoxolone (MM6384NG73)', 'Corticosterone (W980KJ009P)']"

SHR were given intraperitoneal injections of DHEAS (10 mg day-1 for 70 days) from six to 16 weeks of age. The blood pressure-time curve was significantly (P < 0.05) suppressed immediately after administration of DHEAS. There was no difference between the heart rates of control and DHEAS groups. Serum concentrations of corticosterone and dehydrocorticosterone in the DHEAS group were significantly (P < 0.05) lower than those of the control group. The dehydrocorticosterone/corticosterone concentration ratio was, however, significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the DHEAS group, suggesting that treatment with DHEAS enhanced the overall interconversion of corticosterone to dehydrocorticosterone. The activity of 11 beta-HSD in specific organs of the DHEAS group was affected, characteristic changes being increases in the kidney (14-58%), decreases in the liver (11-27%) and no change in the testis. Direct addition of DHEAS to 11 beta-HSD preparations from the kidneys of control SHR had the same effect as that observed in the in-vivo experiments. The fall in serum corticosterone in the DHEAS group is considered to be related, at least partly, to increased activity of kidney 11 beta-HSD.

DPA is specific to the QO site of ubihydroquinone:cytochrome c oxidoreductase, where it inhibits not only reduction of the [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster in the FeS subunit and subsequent cytochrome c reduction but also heme bL reduction in the cytochrome b subunit. In both cases, the kinetic inhibition constant (Ki) is 25 +/- 10 microM. A novel aspect of the mode of action of DPA is that complete inhibition is established without disturbing the interaction between the reduced [2Fe-2S]+ cluster and the QO site ubiquinone complement, as observed from the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectral line shape of the reduced [2Fe-2S] cluster, which remained characteristic of two ubiquinones being present. These observations imply that DPA is behaving as a noncompetitive inhibitor of the QO site. Nevertheless, at higher concentrations (>10 mM), DPA can interfere with the QO site ubiquinone occupancy, leading to a [2Fe-2S] cluster EPR spectrum characteristic of the presence of only one ubiquinone in the QO site. Evidently, DPA can displace the more weakly bound of the two ubiquinones in the site, but this is not requisite for its inhibiting action.']",['eng'],"['Binding Sites/drug effects', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Electron Transport Complex III/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Electron Transport Complex III/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Phenylalanine/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Rhodobacter capsulatus/enzymology', 'Ubiquinone/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Ubiquinone/metabolism']","['Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins', 'Ubiquinone (1339-63-5)', 'Phenylalanine (47E5O17Y3R)', '3,3-diphenylalanine (62653-26-3)', 'Electron Transport Complex III (EC 1.10.2.2)']"

Assisted living is widely seen as a resource for managed care organizations enrolling Medicare beneficiaries. Flexible capitation payments and incentives to substitute services create opportunities for assisted living facilities and HMOs to form partnerships. Enrollment of beneficiaries in Medicare HMOs has reached 4.5 million and is growing over 30% a year. In addition, state Medicaid agencies are developing programs to enroll elders, most of whom are also Medicare beneficiaries, in managed care programs that include long-term care. The move toward managed care and the increasing interest in integrating acute and long-term care for dual eligibles signals a growing role for assisted living facilities as a major resource for elders who need a supportive and service-rich residential living environment.']",['eng'],"['Aged', 'Capitation Fee', 'Health Maintenance Organizations/economics', 'Health Maintenance Organizations/trends', 'Housing for the Elderly/economics', 'Housing for the Elderly/trends', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Organizational Affiliation', 'Rate Setting and Review', 'Reimbursement Mechanisms', 'United States']",

The majority of food allergies among adults is caused by cross-reactivity of IgE against inhalative allergens also reacting with food proteins. This must be considered in investigations by skin-prick testing and/or specific IgE measurement, since the sensitivity of these tests for inhalative allergens is higher than for food proteins. The most frequent differential diagnoses of true allergies are pseudoallergic reactions to food additives or pharmacological reactions to biogenic amines. The diagnosis of these reactions can usually be based on the history and course under a corresponding diet. In clinical practice additional investigations by double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges are rarely required.

From the sensitivity of the reduced [2Fe-2S] cluster electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectral g(x)-band and line shape to the degree and type of Qo site occupants, we have proposed a double-occupancy model for the Qo site by ubiquinone in Rhodobacter capsulatus membrane vesicles containing the cytochrome bc1 complex. Biophysical and biochemical experiments have confirmed the double occupancy model and from a combination of these results and the available cytochrome bc1 crystal structures we suggest that the two ubiquinone molecules in the Qo site serve distinct catalytic roles. We propose that the strongly bound ubiquinone, termed Qos, is close to the [2Fe-2S] cluster, where it remains tightly associated with the Qo site during turnover, serving as a catalytic cofactor; and the weaker bound ubiquinone, Qow, is distal to the [2Fe-2S] cluster and can exchange with the membrane Qpool on a time scale much faster than the turnover, acting as the substrate. The crystallographic data demonstrates that the FeS subunit can adopt different positions. Our own observations show that the equilibrium position of the reduced FeS subunit is proximal to the Qo site. On the basis of this, we also report preliminary results modeling the electron transfer reactions that can occur in the cytochrome bc1 complex and show that because of the strong distance dependence of electron transfer, significant movement of the FeS subunit must occur in order for the complex to be able to turn over at the experimental observed rates.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/metabolism', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Catalysis', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Diphenylamine/pharmacology', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Electron Transport', 'Electron Transport Complex III/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Electron Transport Complex III/chemistry', 'Electron Transport Complex III/genetics', 'Electron Transport Complex III/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/enzymology', 'Models, Chemical', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Polyenes/pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Rhodobacter capsulatus/enzymology', 'Stilbenes/pharmacology', 'Ubiquinone/metabolism']","['Bacterial Proteins', 'Polyenes', 'Stilbenes', '3-methoxy-2-(2-styrylphenyl)propenic acid methyl ester (103455-29-4)', 'Ubiquinone (1339-63-5)', 'stigmatellin (91682-96-1)', 'Diphenylamine (9N3CBB0BIQ)', 'Electron Transport Complex III (EC 1.10.2.2)']"

As early as 1994, when inpatient stays were longer, concern was expressed about the impact of early discharge on the health and well-being of persons with SCI (Ditunno & Formal, 1994). For over 10 years, the Medical Illness Counseling Center (MICC) has offered a community-based, nurse-directed program of Computerized Functional Electrical Stimulation (CFES) for persons with SCI. The program is founded on the belief that when multi-system deterioration associated with paralysis is avoided and a behavioral approach is used, the person with SCI will have a renewed sense of well-being that enables him or her to overcome the challenges of daily living. Over time, the need for expansion of the program became apparent; it evolved into a comprehensive package of medical, nursing, and psychological care. This article describes the essential elements that comprised a successful program design, the benefits of participation in CFES, and the significance of this technology in a nurse-managed setting.""]",['eng'],"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Community Health Centers/organization & administration', 'Electric Stimulation Therapy/methods', 'Electric Stimulation Therapy/nursing', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Models, Organizational', 'Nursing Evaluation Research', 'Patient Care Team/organization & administration', 'Program Evaluation', 'Rehabilitation Centers/organization & administration', 'Spinal Cord Injuries/nursing', 'Spinal Cord Injuries/rehabilitation', 'Therapy, Computer-Assisted/organization & administration']",

In 8 of them ECMO was necessary because of respiratory insufficiency without response to conventional treatment (r-ECMO) and a veno-venous tidal flow system was used. In 14 patients, cardiac ECMO was necessary in the veno-arterial modality because of ventricular failure after extracorporal circulatory assistance during cardiovascular surgery.!##!Results!#!The 8 patients of the respiratory ECMO group had a mean previous oxygenation index of 89 +/- 36.6 (50-150). The mean duration of ECMO was 7.8 +/- 6.5 (1-16) days and the age at the beginning of ECMO ranged between 1 and 151 days.

Two different trialkoxysilylated PEGs were synthesized and characterized. The first trialkoxysilylated PEG was prepared by direct coupling of m-PEG with 3-isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane through a urethane bond (silanated PEG I). The other silanated PEG (silanated PEG II) containing a long hydrophobic domain between PEG and a silane domain was prepared by reacting m-PEG with 1,6-diisocyanatohexane and 10-undecen-1-ol in sequence before silylation with 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane. Silanated PEGs I and II were grafted onto glass, a model surface used in our study. The PEG-grafted glass surfaces were characterized by contact angle, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Although contact angle did not change much as the bulk concentration of silanated PEG used for grafting increased from 0.1 to 20 mg/ml for both PEGs I and II, the surface atomic concentrations from XPS measurements showed successful PEG grafting. Surface PEG grafting increased concentration of surface carbon but decreased silicone concentration. The high resolution C1s spectra showed higher ether carbon with lower hydrocarbon compositions for the PEG-grafted surfaces compared to the control surface. AFM images showed that more PEG molecules were grafted onto the surface as the bulk concentration used for grafting was increased. AFM images of the dried surfaces showed that the surfaces were not completely covered by PEG molecules. After hydration, however, the surface appears to be covered completely probably due to the hydration of the grafted PEG chains. Glass surfaces modified with silanated PEGs reduced fibrinogen adsorption by more than 95% as compared with the control surface.

In order to define the respective involvement of other regulative enzymes in the metabolism of 11-dehydro-glucocorticoids in the liver, the objective of this study was to evaluate the kinetic behavior of NADPH:delta 4-3-ketosteroid-5alpha-reductase (5alpha-reductase, EC 1.3.99.5). The interrelations to liver 11beta-HSD1 will be discussed. The kinetic properties of 5alpha-reductase of the rabbit liver were measured by a radioenzymatic assay and characterized with respect to protein-, substrate-, cosubstrate-, and pH-dependence. Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) were obtained for the formation of 5alpha-reduced 11-dehydrocorticosterone and corticosterone metabolites. We found that both 11-dehydrocorticosterone (Km 4.2 x 10(-6) mol/l, Vmax 2,600 pmol x min(-1) x mg(-1)) and corticosterone (Km 0.5 x 10(-6) mol/l, Vmax 38 pmol x min(-1) x mg(-1)) exhibit a high affinity to 5alpha-reductase. With respect to cosubstrate-, pH-dependence and finasteride inhibition, it is likely that 11-dehydrocorticosterone metabolism is primarily controlled by isoenzyme 5alpha-reductase type 1. This study shows that the deactivation of GCS especially of 11-dehydro-glucocorticoids via 5alpha-reductase is an important metabolic pathway in the liver. The metabolic activation of GCS by 11beta-HSD could possibly lead to an excess of GCS in the hepatocytes. Due to 5alpha-reductase activity this excess can be limited - on the level of CORT as well as of 11-DHC.']",['eng'],"['11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases', '3-Oxo-5-alpha-Steroid 4-Dehydrogenase/metabolism', '5-alpha Reductase Inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Azasteroids/pharmacology', 'Corticosterone/analogs & derivatives', 'Corticosterone/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Finasteride/pharmacology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Rabbits']","['4,7beta-dimethyl-4-azacholestan-3-one', '5-alpha Reductase Inhibitors', 'Azasteroids', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Finasteride (57GNO57U7G)', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.-)', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.146)', '3-Oxo-5-alpha-Steroid 4-Dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.5)', '11-dehydrocorticosterone (FO4V44A3G3)', 'Corticosterone (W980KJ009P)']"

Risk factors include older age, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, immunodeficiency, and a preexisting joint disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) to which the symptoms of septic arthritis are sometimes ascribed. Staphylococcus aureus contributes over two-thirds of identified organisms; a range of streptococci and gram-negative bacilli are next in frequency. The most common site is the knee, followed by the hip and shoulder. Over 10% of patients have polyarticular involvement reflecting bacteremia and diminished resistance to infection; (over 50% of polyarticular forms occur in rheumatoid arthritis patients). Prosthetic joint infection is becoming increasingly common; chronic forms due to intraoperative contamination and resulting in septic loosening should be distinguished from acute hematogenous infection in which emergency treatment can allow to salvage the prosthesis. Demonstration of the organism in the joint is the key to the diagnosis. Joint aspiration should be performed on an emergency basis, if needed after identification of radiographic landmarks or under ultrasonographic guidance. Seeding the fluid on blood culture flasks immediately after aspiration increases the yield. Antibiotics should be started as soon as the microbiological specimens have been collected. When aspiration is difficult (hip) or inadequate, arthroscopic drainage usually makes arthrotomy unnecessary. Early antiinflammatory therapy (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, systemic or local glucocorticoids, anticytokines, and antiinflammatory cytokines) are being considered as tools for limiting joint damage; their efficacy and safety will first have to be established in animal studies.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Arthritis, Infectious/epidemiology', 'Arthritis, Infectious/microbiology', 'Arthritis, Infectious/physiopathology', 'Arthritis, Infectious/therapy', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Joints/microbiology', 'Joints/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Staphylococcal Infections/epidemiology', 'Staphylococcal Infections/microbiology', 'Staphylococcal Infections/physiopathology', 'Staphylococcus aureus/isolation & purification']",

Failure to respond to INO is multifactorial. We hypothesized that the addition of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) might modify the response to INO in patients who had previously failed to respond to INO.!##!Methods!#!Patients with ARDS who failed to respond to INO at 1 ppm (PaO2 increase of < 20%) were selected. Each patient underwent a PEEP trial using an improvement in static lung compliance as the end point. One hour after the new PEEP level was reached, hemodynamic and blood gas values were obtained. INO was then reinstituted at 1 ppm, and hemodynamic and blood gas variables were obtained 1 hour later.!##!Results!#!Six of nine patients demonstrated an increase in PaO2/FIO2 (161 +/- 27 to 186 +/- 29) with a mean increase in PEEP of 3.7 cm H2O. Each patient responding to PEEP further improved PaO2/FIO2 (186 +/- 29 to 223 +/- 36) with INO at 1 ppm. The three patients who failed to improve after the PEEP increase also failed to respond to a second trial of INO. There were no changes in cardiac output or systemic vascular resistance. Pulmonary artery pressures decreased slightly (39 +/- 5 vs 38 +/- 7 vs 35 +/- 9 mm Hg). Pulmonary vascular resistance decreased significantly after reintroduction of INO (298 +/- 131 vs 310 +/- 122 vs 249 +/- 105 dynes/sec/cm-5) in patients who responded positively.!##!Conclusions!#!The response of ARDS patients to INO can be improved if optimum alveolar recruitment is achieved by the addition of PEEP.

These studies suggest that aromatherapy massage has a mild, transient anxiolytic effect. Based on a critical assessment of the six studies relating to relaxation, the effects of aromatherapy are probably not strong enough for it to be considered for the treatment of anxiety. The hypothesis that it is effective for any other indication is not supported by the findings of rigorous clinical trials.']",['eng'],"['Anxiety/therapy', 'Aromatherapy/methods', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Massage/methods', 'Oils, Volatile/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']","['Oils, Volatile']"
M10969125,"['Unsafe sleep practices and an analysis of bedsharing among infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly: results of a four-year, population-based, death-scene investigation study of sudden infant death syndrome and related deaths.']","[""Background!#!Prone sleep and unsafe sleep surfaces increase the risk of sudden infant death. Recent epidemiologic studies also suggest that when an infant's head or face is covered by bedding, or when a sleep surface is shared with others, the risk of dying increases. The inference of a causal role for these risk factors is supported by physiologic studies and by the consistent finding that fewer infants die when risk factors are reduced. The prevalence of most of these risk factors in infant deaths in the United States is uncertain.!##!Objective!#!To describe the prevalence of several important risk factors related to sleep practices among a defined population of infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly.!##!Methods!#!In this population-based study, we retrospectively reviewed death-scene information and medical examiners' investigations of deaths in the city of St Louis and St Louis County between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 1997. Because of the potential for diagnostic overlap, all deaths involving infants <2 years old with the diagnoses of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), accidental suffocation, or cause undetermined were included.!##!Results!#!The deaths of 119 infants were studied. Their mean age was 109.3 days (range: 6-350). The diagnoses were SIDS in 88 deaths, accidental suffocation in 16, and undetermined in 15. Infants were found prone in 61.1% of cases and were found on a sleep surface not designed for infants in 75.9%. The head or face was covered by bedding in 29.4%. A shared sleep surface was the site of death in 47.1%. Only 8.4% of deaths involved infants found nonprone and alone, with head and face uncovered.!##!Conclusions!#!Using detailed death-scene descriptions, we found that similar unsafe sleeping practices occurred in the large majority of cases diagnosed as SIDS, accidental suffocation, and cause undetermined. Considering these diagnoses together may be useful in public health campaigns during a time when there may be diagnostic overlap. Regardless of the diagnosis, recommendations that infants sleep supine on firm sleep surfaces that lessen the risk of entrapment or head covering have the potential to save many lives. Campaigns are needed to heighten awareness of these messages and of the risks of dangerous bedsharing.""]",['eng'],"['Asphyxia/complications', 'Asphyxia Neonatorum/complications', 'Bedding and Linens/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Prone Position', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sleep', 'Sudden Infant Death/epidemiology', 'Sudden Infant Death/etiology', 'Sudden Infant Death/prevention & control', 'United States/epidemiology']",

Biliary tract replacement is less common. The purpose of this retrospective multicentric study was to evaluate the safety of appendix grafting for biliary reconstruction.!##!Methods!#!The files of 33 patients treated at 7 European pediatric centers were reviewed. Indications included choledochal cyst (CC) in 5 cases, biliary trauma (BT) in 1, and biliary atresia (BA) in 27. In CC and BT patients, the graft was inserted isoperistaltically between the proximal biliary duct and second duodenum. In all but one of the BA patients, the graft was placed antiperistaltically by patching its cecal end onto the porta hepatis.!##!Results!#!Postoperatively, all CC and BT patients initially became asymptomatic but developed laboratory evidence of anicteric cholestasis within 1 year. The most common manifestation was increased gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase level (GGT), whereas histologic findings showed liver damage (mainly fibrosis). Reoperation has been carried out in 4 CC and 1 BT patients within a mean period of 19 months after appendix grafting. The graft procedure was converted to hepaticojejunostomy (HJ) in 4 and to choledocoduodenostomy in 1. Surgical exploration showed kinking in 1 patient and stenosis in 1. In the remaining 3 cases, there was no discernible cause of cholestasis, and appendix histology findings were normal. In all 5 reoperated patients, liver function findings returned to normal within 1 month. Reoperation is scheduled for the remaining CC patient who currently requires ursodesoxycholic medication to maintain normal liver function and presents histologic evidence of ""de novo"" sclerosing cholangitis. Results of appendix grafting also were poor in the 27 BA patients. Procedure-related perioperative complications occurred in 4 (15%) including 1 early death from graft necrosis. Another early death resulted from intestinal hemorrhage. Jaundice cleared in only 8 (28%).!##!Conclusions!#!The findings of this study suggest that the AG is unsuitable for routine biliary repair in children. It should be used only as a salvage technique when conventional HJ repair is contraindicated. Because of the high risk of graft dysfunction, we recommend screening tests to detect biochemical or histologic cholestasis in any patient previously treated with appendix grafting.']",['eng'],"['Adolescent', 'Appendix/transplantation', 'Biliary Atresia/surgery', 'Biliary Tract Diseases/surgery', 'Child, Preschool', 'Choledochal Cyst/surgery', 'Common Bile Duct/injuries', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Postoperative Complications/epidemiology', 'Postoperative Complications/mortality', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures/methods', 'Reoperation', 'Treatment Outcome']",

The molecular mechanisms for this process remain unknown, but current views suggest that the plastoquinone pool directly controls the activation of the kinase. On the basis of enzyme activation by a pH shift in the darkness combined with flash photolysis, EPR, and optical spectroscopy we propose that activation occurs when plastoquinol occupies the quinol-oxidation (Qo) site of the cytochrome bf complex, having its high-potential path components in a reduced state. A linear correlation between kinase activation and accessibility of the Qo site to plastoquinol was established by quantification of the shift in the g(y) EPR signal of the Rieske Fe-S center resulting from displacement of the Qo-site plastoquinol by a quinone analog. Activity persists as long as one plastoquinol per cytochrome bf is still available. Withdrawal of one electron from this plastoquinol after a single-turnover flash exciting photosystem I leads to deactivation of the kinase parallel with a decrease in the g(z) EPR signal of the reduced Rieske Fe-S center. Cytochrome f, plastocyanin, and P(700) are rereduced after the flash, indicating that the plastoquinol at the Qo site is limiting in maintaining the kinase activity. These results give direct evidence for a functional cytochrome bf-kinase interaction, analogous to a signal transduction system where the cytochrome bf is the receptor and the ligand is the plastoquinol at the Qo site.']",['eng'],,

Endometriosis is a common disease that does not create a cachectic or catabolic state, and is rarely fatal. There are, however, numerous reported cases of malignancy arising from endometriotic deposits and substantial histologic evidence that endometriosis is associated with endometrioid carcinoma and clear cell carcinoma of the ovary. A large review article by Mostoufizadeh and Scully investigated the association between endometriosis and endometrioid carcinoma, noting that women who had both diseases tended to be younger [1]. They found no association between endometriosis and serous or mucinous carcinoma of the ovary, and reported that malignant transformation of endometriosis was rare and associated with the use of exogenous estrogens. An epidemiological study of Swedish women reported a higher incidence of breast and ovarian cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in women with endometriosis compared with controls [2]. Vercellini and colleagues also reported a higher incidence of endometrioid and clear cell carcinoma in women with endometriosis compared with controls [3]. Mutations in genes associated with galactose metabolism have been identified as one possible mechanism for this association.

We observed the opposite result when assessing the effects of UDCA on the apoptotic response to mitochondrial photodamage induced by photodynamic therapy (PDT). Two photosensitizers with predominantly mitochondrial specificity were used: a porphycene we have designated CPO; and the tin etiopurpurin SnET2. UDCA potentiated the loss of mitochondrial potential, release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, activation of caspase-3, and apoptotic cell death after irradiation of photosensitized murine leukemia L1210 or hepatoma 1c1c7 cells. These effects were not observed when UDCA was added after irradiation. Glyco-UDCA and tauro-UDCA, conjugated forms of UDCA that are formed in vivo, were as effective as UDCA in promoting PDT phototoxicity. Because UDCA does not act by enhancing intracellular accumulation of the photosensitizing agents used in this study, we propose that the mode of action of UDCA involves the sensitization of mitochondrial membranes to photodamage. UDCA is used currently in gastroenterology for several indications.

M11305228,['The magnocellular theory of developmental dyslexia.'],"[""Low literacy is termed 'developmental dyslexia' when reading is significantly behind that expected from the intelligence quotient (IQ) in the presence of other symptoms--incoordination, left-right confusions, poor sequencing--that characterize it as a neurological syndrome. 5-10% of children, particularly boys, are found to be dyslexic. Reading requires the acquisition of good orthographic skills for recognising the visual form of words which allows one to access their meaning directly. It also requires the development of good phonological skills for sounding out unfamiliar words using knowledge of letter sound conversion rules. In the dyslexic brain, temporoparietal language areas on the two sides are symmetrical without the normal left-sided advantage. Also brain 'warts' (ectopias) are found, particularly clustered round the left temporoparietal language areas. The visual magnocellular system is responsible for timing visual events when reading. It therefore signals any visual motion that occurs if unintended movements lead to images moving off the fovea ('retinal slip'). These signals are then used to bring the eyes back on target. Thus, sensitivity to visual motion seems to help determine how well orthographic skill can develop in both good and bad readers. In dyslexics, the development of the visual magnocellular system is impaired: development of the magnocellular layers of the dyslexic lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is abnormal; their motion sensitivity is reduced; many dyslexics show unsteady binocular fixation; hence poor visual localization, particularly on the left side (left neglect). Dyslexics' binocular instability and visual perceptual instability, therefore, can cause the letters they are trying to read to appear to move around and cross over each other. Hence, blanking one eye (monocular occlusion) can improve reading. Thus, good magnocellular function is essential for high motion sensitivity and stable binocular fixation, hence proper development of orthographic skills. Many dyslexics also have auditory/phonological problems. Distinguishing letter sounds depends on picking up the changes in sound frequency and amplitude that characterize them. Thus, high frequency (FM) and amplitude modulation (AM) sensitivity helps the development of good phonological skill, and low sensitivity impedes the acquisition of these skills. Thus dyslexics' sensitivity to FM and AM is significantly lower than that of good readers and this explains their problems with phonology. The cerebellum is the head ganglion of magnocellular systems; it contributes to binocular fixation and to inner speech for sounding out words, and it is clearly defective in dyslexics. Thus, there is evidence that most reading problems have a fundamental sensorimotor cause. But why do magnocellular systems fail to develop properly? There is a clear genetic basis for impaired development of magnocells throughout the brain. The best understood linkage is to the region of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class 1 on the short arm of chromosome 6 which helps to control the production of antibodies. The development of magnocells may be impaired by autoantibodies affecting the developing brain. Magnocells also need high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids to preserve the membrane flexibility that permits the rapid conformational changes of channel proteins which underlie their transient sensitivity. But the genes that underlie magnocellular weakness would not be so common unless there were compensating advantages to dyslexia. In developmental dyslexics there may be heightened development of parvocellular systems that underlie their holistic, artistic, 'seeing the whole picture' and entrepreneurial talents.""]",['eng'],"['Brain/metabolism', 'Brain/physiopathology', 'Cerebellum/physiopathology', 'Child', 'Creativity', 'Dyslexia/diagnosis', 'Dyslexia/genetics', 'Dyslexia/physiopathology', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/metabolism', 'Fixation, Ocular/physiology', 'Humans', 'Motion Perception/physiology', 'Parietal Lobe/physiopathology', 'Phonetics', 'Psychological Theory', 'Vision, Binocular/physiology', 'Visual Cortex/physiopathology', 'Visual Fields/physiology', 'Visual Perception/physiology']","['Fatty Acids, Unsaturated']"

For controlling any selection bias and potential regional differences, the initial DSL trends of the 197 baseline course participants were compared with two control groups, namely other insured from the programme region and control regions. DSL trends in the three groups prior to the course program were identical. Subsequently DSL due to ICD-9 Codes 710-739 were reduced more substantially in course participants than in controls: 25.5 versus 33 or 32 days respectively. A covariance analysis model that also considered socio-economic factors and pre-intervention DSL levels yeilded a 14-day reduction in DSL (p value 0.023). This is a clear effect on DSL trends taht may be utilised for net savings for AOK.

In a year-long prospective study we examined the opinions and practices of parents with regard to their infants' nighttime sleeping strategies before and after the birth of their babies. Results confirm that parents pursue a heterogeneous array of nighttime parenting strategies and that 65 percent of the sample had actually bedshared. Parents with no previous intention to do so slept with their babies for a variety of reasons. One of this study's most important findings is that babies were being brought into bed with both parents. Ninety five percent of the bedsharing infants slept with both mother and father. This study has shown that bedsharing is a relatively common parenting practice. Despite initial worries and fears, mainly concerning overlaying, some parents found bedsharing an effective option yet were covert in their practices, fearing the disapproval of health professionals and relatives.""]",['eng'],"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anthropology, Cultural', 'Attitude', 'England', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Care', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Parenting', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sleep']",

Rubisco activity was measured both in vivo and in vitro using a spectrophotometric technique in mature Pinus taeda L. (loblolly pine) trees grown using free-air CO2 enrichment in elevated (56 Pa) and current (36 Pa) pCO2. In addition, for studies where both in vivo and in vitro values of Rubisco activity were reported net CO2 uptake rate (A) was modelled based on the in vivo and in vitro values of Rubisco activity reported in the literature. Both the modelling exercise and the experimental data showed that the in vitro values of Rubisco activity were insufficient to account for the observed values of A. A trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation of the protein from samples taken in parallel with those used for activity analysis was co-electrophoresed with the extract used for determining in vitro Rubisco activity. There was significantly more Rubisco present in the TCA precipitated samples, suggesting that the underestimation of Rubisco activity in vitro was attributable to an insufficient extraction of Rubisco protein prior to activity analysis. Correction of in vitro values to account for the under-represented Rubisco yielded mechanistically valid values for Rubisco activity. However, despite the low absolute values for Rubisco activity determined in vitro, the trends reported with CO2 treatment concurred with, and were of equal magnitude to, those observed in Rubisco activity measured in vivo.']",['eng'],"['Carbon Dioxide/metabolism', 'Cycadopsida/enzymology', 'Models, Biological', 'Photosynthesis/physiology', 'Pinus taeda', 'Plant Proteins/drug effects', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase/drug effects', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase/metabolism', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Trichloroacetic Acid/pharmacology']","['Plant Proteins', 'Carbon Dioxide (142M471B3J)', 'Trichloroacetic Acid (5V2JDO056X)', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.39)']"

Using near infrared spectroscopy changes in cerebral blood volume and cerebral oxygenation index were assessed. Heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation, PCO2, and arterial blood pressure were registered continuously. Data were compared at 30, 60 and 120 seconds after the beginning of suctioning and surfactant administration.!##!Results!#!Endotracheal suctioning and surfactant administration induced a similar decrease in heart rate (-29/min, SD 25, p < 0.01 and -30/min, SD 23, p < 0.001) during the first 30 seconds and in oxygen saturation at the 30 seconds datapoint (-3%, SD 2, p < 0.01 and -3%, SD 6, p < 0.05). The decrease in oxygen saturation persisted at 60 seconds after the start of suctioning (-4%, SD 5, p < 0.05). In contrast, oxygen saturation was no longer different from baseline levels 60 seconds after surfactant administration (+1%, SD 6, p = 0.5). After suctioning, cerebral oxygenation index had decreased significantly from baseline levels at 30, 60, and 120 seconds. In contrast, after surfactant administration, no significant difference from baseline was noted at 30 and 60 seconds and a significant increase occurred at 120 seconds.

Focusing on four areas--sources of support and advice; infant feeding; infant sleeping arrangements; and traditional practices and beliefs--it explores inter-ethnic similarities and differences and intra-ethnic tensions. The international literature indicates that there can be significant cultural variation in infant care practices and in the meanings attributed to them. There is, however, little New Zealand literature on this topic, despite its importance for effective health service and health message delivery. Participants were primary caregivers of infants under 12 months. An average of six focus groups were conducted within each ethnic group, resulting in a total of 37 groups comprising 150 participants. We found similarities across all ethnic groups in the perceived importance of breastfeeding and the difficulties experienced in establishing and maintaining this practice. The spectrum of behaviours ranged widely with differences most pronounced between Pacific caregivers, especially those Island-raised, and Pakeha caregivers, especially those in nuclear families. Amongst the former, norms included: the family as central in providing support and advice; infant bedsharing; abdominal rubbing during pregnancy; baby massage; and the importance of adhering to traditional protocols to ensure infant well-being. Amongst the latter, norms included: strong reliance on professional advice; looser family support networks; the infant sleeping in a cot; and adherence to Western biomedical understandings of health and illness. Maori caregivers bridged the spectrum created by these groups and exhibited a diverse range of practices. Intra-cultural differences were present in all groups indicating the dynamic nature of cultural practices. They were most evident between Pacific-raised and New Zealand-raised Pacific caregivers, with the latter attempting to marry traditional with Western beliefs and practices.']",['eng'],"['Breast Feeding', 'Cross-Cultural Comparison', 'Culture', 'Ethnic Groups/psychology', 'Europe/ethnology', 'Focus Groups', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Care/methods', 'Infant Care/psychology', 'Infant, Newborn', 'New Zealand', 'Oceanic Ancestry Group/psychology', 'Pacific Islands/ethnology', 'Parenting/ethnology', 'Sleep', 'Social Support']",

A pulmonary artery flotation catheter was in place as part of their routine management. Changes in PEEP were made from 0 to 14 cm H2O to determine the level of PEEP, which increased PO(2) without decreasing cardiac output (ie, assessment of best PEEP). Static lung compliance and auto-PEEP were obtained from the pressure signal on the ventilator. The change in Pra with a spontaneous inspiratory effort (ie, triggered breath) was used to determine whether patients had a restrictive (ie, operating on the flat part of the Starling curve), or nonrestrictive pattern (acting on the ascending part of the Starling curve) as previously described.!##!Results!#!Cardiac output decreased 0.7 +/- 0.8 L/min (change from baseline P <.05) in the group with an inspiratory decrease in Pra and -0.04 +/- 1.50 L/min (P = NS) in the group without an inspiratory decrease in Pra. The groups were not significantly different. However, the variance in cardiac output was large and, in contrast to our hypothesis, two patients in the group with an inspiratory decrease in Pra did not have a decrease in cardiac output. Pra and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure after the PEEP trial were greater than before, indicating that reflex circulatory adjustments occurred in response to the PEEP.!##!Conclusions!#!The inspiratory pattern in Pra does not predict the response to cardiac output to PEEP in individual patients. This is most likely because of reflex adaptations in the circuit that occur with the application of PEEP. The response of a patient to PEEP is affected by the patient's volume reserves, filling status of the right atrium, and neurosympathetic activity.""]",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Atrial Function, Right', 'Cardiac Output/physiology', 'Hemodynamics', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Positive-Pressure Respiration', 'Respiratory Function Tests', 'United States']",

In the emergency room many patients with acute back pain are treated with intravenous non-steroidal analgesics. Whether this treatment is superior to oral administration of non-steroidal analgesics is unknown. Intravenous administration, however, requires considerable amounts of resources and accounts for high workload in busy clinics. In the further course centrally acting muscle relaxants are prescribed but the effectiveness remains unclear. The objective of this study is on the one hand to compare the effectiveness of intravenous with oral non-steroidal analgesics for acute treatment and on the other hand to compare the effectiveness of a centrally active muscle relaxant with placebo given for three days after presentation to the ED (emergency department). METHODS/DESIGN: This study is intended as a randomised controlled factorial trial mainly for two reasons: (1) the sequence of treatments resembles the actual proceedings in every-day clinical practice, which is important for the generalisability of the results and (2) this design allows to take interactions between the two sequential treatment strategies into account. There is a patient preference arm included because patients preference is an important issue providing valuable information: (1) it allows to assess the interaction between desired treatment and outcome, (2) results can be extrapolated to a wider group while (3) conserving the advantages of a fully randomised controlled trial. CONCLUSION: We hope to shed more light on the effectiveness of treatment modalities available for acute low back pain.']",['eng'],,

The aim of the present study was to determine the cellular expression of GR, MR, 11betaHSD1, and 11betaHSD2 in neonatal rat heart and determine the role these enzymes play in modulating glucocorticoid and aldosterone action. Ribonuclease protection analysis and steroid binding assays showed that GR is expressed in both cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts, whereas MR is expressed only in myocytes. 11betaHSD2 was not detected in cardiac cells, but 11betaHSD1 was expressed at high levels in both cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts. Enzyme activity studies demonstrated that 11betaHSD1 acted as a reductase only, converting biologically inactive 11-dehydrocorticosterone to corticosterone, which then stimulated serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase gene transcription via GR. In both cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts, aldosterone stimulated serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase gene expression exclusively via GR, but not MR, indicating that aldosterone can have glucocorticoid-like actions in heart. The ability of cardiac cells to use both circulating corticosterone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone as a source of glucocorticoid suggests that the heart is under tonic glucocorticoid control, implying that glucocorticoids play important homeostatic roles in the heart.']",['eng'],"['11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Corticosterone/analogs & derivatives', 'Corticosterone/genetics', 'Corticosterone/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/pharmacology', 'Immediate-Early Proteins', 'Myocardium/cytology', 'Myocardium/enzymology', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/metabolism', 'Receptors, Mineralocorticoid/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects']","['Immediate-Early Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid', 'Receptors, Mineralocorticoid', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.-)', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.146)', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases (EC 2.7.11.1)', 'serum-glucocorticoid regulated kinase (EC 2.7.11.1)', '11-dehydrocorticosterone (FO4V44A3G3)', 'Corticosterone (W980KJ009P)']"

The goal of this study was to determine the frequency of oronasal blood in sudden infant deaths and to examine possible causative factors. Oronasal blood was described in 28 (7%) of 406 cases of sudden infant death. Oronasal blood could not be attributed to cardiopulmonary resuscitation in 14 cases, including 10 (3%) of 300 cases of SIDS, 2 (14%) of 14 accidental suffocation cases, and 2 (15%) of 13 undetermined cases. Eight of the 10 infants in cases of sudden infant death were bedsharing: 5 with both parents, 2 between both parents. The infant in 1 SIDS case was from a family that had had three referrals to Child Protective Services. Oronasal blood not attributable to cardiopulmonary resuscitation occurs rarely in SIDS when the infant is sleeping supine in a safe environment. Bedsharing may place infants at risk of suffocation from overlaying. Oronasal blood observed before cardiopulmonary resuscitation is given is probably of oronasal skin or mucous membrane origin and may be a sign of accidental or inflicted suffocation. Sanguineous secretions that are mucoid or frothy are likely of remote origin, such as lung alveoli. The use of an otoscope to establish the origin of oronasal blood in cases of sudden infant death is recommended.']",['eng'],"['California/epidemiology', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/adverse effects', 'Comorbidity', 'Epistaxis/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Care/methods', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mouth', 'Mucus/chemistry', 'Nasal Mucosa/blood supply', 'Observer Variation', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sudden Infant Death/epidemiology']",

In the present study, we focused on three of the deficits which have been thought to accompany and to a certain extent, to explain dyslexia: an abnormal pattern of hemispheric asymmetry, abnormal hemispheric communication, and abnormal motor control. The aim of the present study was to determine whether adults with reading difficulties perform differently from control subjects in a visuo-manual pointing task, in which the subject was required to point with the right or the left hand to targets appearing to the right or left of a central fixation point. A total of 14 dyslexic adults and 14 control adults participated in this experiment. Motor control was assessed based on the time taken to perform the pointing task, hemispheric asymmetry in terms of the inter-hand differences in the reaction and movement times, and hemispheric communication based on the interhemispheric transfer time under crossed conditions, where the hand and the target were not on the same side. The results showed that neither hemispheric asymmetry nor interhemispheric transfer differed between dyslexic and control adults. However, the dyslexics were significantly slower when performing the pointing task. These results are in agreement with the hypothesis that dyslexia may involve a mild motor deficit.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Cerebral Cortex/physiology', 'Comorbidity', 'Dyslexia/physiopathology', 'Electronic Data Processing', 'Female', 'Functional Laterality', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Motor Skills Disorders/physiopathology', 'Reaction Time']",

We tested the hypothesis that the increased respiratory rate used in the ARDSNet lower VT strategy might have led to intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP(i)), raising total PEEP (PEEP(total)). Ten patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were ventilated using the ARDSNet lower VT protocol. Respiratory rate was then reduced (10-15 breaths/minute) to obtain a VT of 12 ml/kg (ARDSNet traditional VT). PEEP on the ventilator (PEEP(nominal): 10.1 +/- 0.7 cm H2O), FIO2 (0.7 +/- 0.1), and minute ventilation (VE: 12.4 +/- 1.7 L/minute) were set using the ARDSNet protocol and maintained constant during the two ventilatory strategies. Values of airway pressure at end-expiration of a regular breath (PEEP(external)) and 3-5 seconds after the onset of an end-expiratory occlusion (PEEP(total)) were measured. PEEP(i) was calculated by subtracting PEEP(external) from PEEP(total).

However, posterior epistaxis is occasionally complicated and needs hospitalization. The aim of this study is to analyze the etiology of epistaxis that requires hospitalization, and present the results of the treatments.!##!Methods!#!From June 1997 to May 1999, 44 patients admitted under diagnosis of epistaxis were retrospectively investigated. Among these patients, 7 were admitted twice for epistaxis. The demographics, administrative history, post-history and associated diseases, treatment and complications were analyzed. Noninterventional treatment comprised of nasal packing and local electrocauterization; interventional treatment included surgery and embolization.!##!Results!#!The mean age of the patients enrolled was 53.4 years. Men outnumbered women in a rate of 3:1. The mean length for hospital stays was 8.1 days for noninterventionally-treated patients, 11.8 days for interventionally-treated patients. Emergency room visit prior to admission was noted in 68.6% of the patients. Hypertension, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after radiotherapy, a history of nasal operations and smoking were four major associated diseases. The failure rate to control the epistaxis was 26.7% for noninterventional treatments and 16.7% for interventional treatments. The complication rate was 2% for the entire study, and the mortality rate was 7.8%. All the mortal patients were post-irradiation NPC patients with internal carotid artery bleeding.!##!Conclusions!#!Most epistaxis patients can be managed in a noninterventional manner.

M12045014,['Regulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release by luminal calcium in cardiac muscle.'],"['The amount of Ca2+ released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is a principal determinant of cardiac contractility. Normally, the SR Ca2+ stores are mobilized through the mechanism of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). In this process, Ca2+ enters the cell through plasmalemmal voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels to activate the Ca2+ release channels in the SR membrane. Consequently, the control of Ca2+ release by cytosolic Ca2+ has traditionally been the main focus of cardiac excitation-contraction (EC) coupling research. Evidence obtained recently suggests that SR Ca release is controlled not only by cytosolic Ca2+, but also by Ca2+ in the lumen of the SR. The presence of a luminal Ca2+ sensor regulating release of SR luminal Ca2+ potentially has profound implications for our understanding of EC coupling and intracellular Ca2+ cycling. Here we review evidence, obtained using in situ and in vitro approaches, in support of such a luminal Ca2+ sensor in cardiac muscle. We also discuss the role of control of Ca2+ release channels by luminal Ca2+ in termination and stabilization of CICR, as well as in shaping the response of cardiac myocytes to various inotropic influences and diseased states such as Ca2+ overload and heart failure.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Calcium Channels/physiology', 'Heart/physiology', 'Heart/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Myocardium/cytology', 'Myocardium/metabolism', 'Myocardium/pathology', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum/pathology', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum/physiology']","['Calcium Channels', 'Calcium (SY7Q814VUP)']"

ETF-QO is an integral membrane protein, and the primary sequences of human and porcine ETF-QO were deduced from the sequences of the cloned cDNAs. We have expressed human ETF-QO in Sf9 insect cells using a baculovirus vector. The cDNA encoding the entire protein, including the mitochondrial targeting sequence, was present in the vector. We isolated a membrane-bound form of the enzyme that has a molecular mass identical with that of the mature porcine protein as determined by SDS/PAGE and has an N-terminal sequence that is identical with that predicted for the mature holoenzyme. These data suggest that the heterologously expressed ETF-QO is targeted to mitochondria and processed to the mature, catalytically active form. The detergent-solubilized protein was purified by ion-exchange and hydroxyapatite chromatography. Absorption and EPR spectroscopy and redox titrations are consistent with the presence of flavin and iron-sulphur centres that are very similar to those in the equivalent porcine and bovine proteins.

Following absorption into the eye, the free acid form of travoprost interacts with the endogenous FP prostanoid receptor to enhance aqueous humor outflow and lower intraocular pressure (IOP). Travoprost is distinguished from other marketed prostaglandin analogues in that it is a full agonist at the prostaglandin receptor. It is also highly selective with little or no affinity for other prostanoid or non-prostanoid receptors in the eye. Travoprost provides robust lowering of IOP with little diurnal fluctuation and results in low target pressures in a large percentage of patients. In controlled clinical trials, travoprost 0.004% o.d. used as monotherapy produced greater IOP reduction than timolol 0.5% b.i.d. and equal or greater reduction than latanoprost 0.005%o.d. Travoprost 0.004% was also shown to be an effective adjunctive agent offering an additional 5 - 7 mmHg IOP reduction in patients inadequately controlled on timolol 0.5%. Subgroup analysis of a large Phase III trial revealed travoprost 0.004% to be significantly more effective at lowering IOP in African American patients by almost 2 mmHg compared to non-African Americans. Moreover, a higher percentage of African American patients responded to travoprost 0.004% and reached lower target pressures than with either latanoprost 0.005% or timolol 0.5%. Travoprost is a very stable compound, maintaining its efficacy following exposure to extremely low and high temperatures, repeated freezing and thawing and exposure to light. Throughout all clinical trials, travoprost was found to be safe and well-tolerated with very few (< 5%) discontinuations due to adverse events. Travoprost 0.004% represents a clinically significant advance for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension, offering superior IOP reduction and diurnal control, especially among African American patients, in a safe, well-tolerated, stable formulation.']",['eng'],"['Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/therapeutic use', 'Antihypertensive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cloprostenol/administration & dosage', 'Cloprostenol/analogs & derivatives', 'Cloprostenol/pharmacology', 'Cloprostenol/therapeutic use', 'Continental Population Groups', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Glaucoma/drug therapy', 'Glaucoma/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Intraocular Pressure/drug effects', 'Ocular Hypertension/drug therapy', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin/drug effects', 'Timolol/therapeutic use', 'Travoprost']","['Adrenergic beta-Antagonists', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin', 'prostaglandin F2alpha receptor', 'Cloprostenol (4208238832)', 'Timolol (817W3C6175)', 'Travoprost (WJ68R08KX9)']"

Through the use of Familial Advance Planning Evaluations (FAPEs), however, psychologists can assist individuals and families in facing end-of-life transitions in important ways. Hospice and palliative care philosophy treats the patient and family as the unit of care. End-of-life decision-making is therefore a family matter as well as a normative developmental transition. Yet, little is known about the decision-making process. This paper reviews the literature regarding informed consent, advance care planning, and proxy decision-making and outlines a theoretical model for familial decision-making. Previous models of end-of-life capacity evaluations and family assessments are presented and serve as the basis for a comprehensive assessment of familial decision-making at the end of life. Functional capacity evaluations of individuals at the end of life regarding decisions about life-sustaining medical treatments enable both the individual patient and one identified proxy from his or her family to discuss important issues families may face during medical crises at the end of life. The information gleaned from such evaluations has the potential to assist psychologists and other professionals in designing family-specific interventions to reduce caregiving distress, improve quality of life for dying patients, and ease the transition to bereavement for caregivers.']",['eng'],"['Decision Making', 'Family', 'Health Services/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Proxy/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Terminal Care/legislation & jurisprudence']",

M12221486,['The history of research into the disorders of reading and accommodation in strabismic amblyopia.'],"['During the past 150 years, research on amblyopia and nystagmus has developed in five different waves (W1-W5). Amblyopia was initially regarded to be enigmatic and believed to be related to eccentric fixation (W1, after 1850); later, it was ascribed to disorders in refraction or accommodation (W2, around 1900). After 1900 (W3), phylogenetic explanations appeared, and after 1945 (W4) concepts based on successful orthoptic practice came to the fore. Since 1965 (W5), research on amblyopia has been guided by modern insights into neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. In contrast to amblyopia, nystagmus has always been a well-defined symptomatic entity. Even though amblyopia and nystagmus are both symptoms of strabismus, their understanding has therefore developed along different paths. In juvenile strabismus, defects in binocularity lead to monolateral amblyopia, while defects in contour vision lead to bilateral nystagmus. In the present paper, these five waves of amblyopia research are described in more detail, with particular attention to the concepts of adaptation, visual fields, and sensory and motor functions as related to disorders in reading and accommodation.']",['eng'],"['Accommodation, Ocular', 'Adaptation, Ocular', 'Amblyopia/history', 'Dyslexia/history', 'History, 16th Century', 'History, 17th Century', 'History, 18th Century', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Ocular Motility Disorders/history', 'Ophthalmology/history', 'Research/history', 'Strabismus/history', 'Visual Fields']",

Sanchez de Jimenez, L. Medrano, and E. Martinez-Barajas [1995] Biochemistry 34: 2826-2831). Rubisco was heat-treated in both the carbamylated and uncarbamylated forms and in the presence and absence of 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Both forms were highly resistant to heat denaturation and further protection was gained in the presence of DTT. A 50% loss in total activity occurred after 1 h at 57.5 and 55.2[deg]C for uncarbamylated Rubisco and at 60.2 and 59.6[deg]C for carbamylated Rubisco, in each case with and without DTT, respectively. In contrast, Rubisco activase lost 50% activity after only 5 min at 33[deg]C and the loss in activity was not affected by the presence of Rubisco. When Rubisco, heat-denatured to various extents, was incubated at room temperature with Rubisco activase or bovine serum albumin as a control, Rubisco activase did not have a significant specific ability to restore Rubisco activity. We conclude that Rubisco activase alone does not have the ability to restore the activity of heat-denatured Rubisco and is unlikely to protect or restore Rubisco activity from heat denaturation in vivo because it is more heat-labile than Rubisco.']",['eng'],,

Rubisco regulation was assessed by measuring (a) the ratio of initial to total Rubisco activity, which reflects primarily the carbamylation state of the enzyme, and (b) total Rubisco activity per mol of Rubisco catalytic sites, which declines when 2-carboxyarabinitol 1-phosphate (CA1P) binds to carbamylated Rubisco. In all species examined, the activity ratio of Rubisco declined with a reduction in light intensity, although substantial variation was apparent between species in the degree of Rubisco deactivation. No relationship existed between the degree of Rubisco deactivation and C4 subtype. Dicots generally deactivated Rubisco to a greater degree than monocots. The total activity of Rubisco per catalytic site was generally independent of light intensity, indicating that CA1P and other inhibitors are not major contributors to the light-dependent regulation of Rubisco activity in C4 plants. The light response of the activity ratio of Rubisco was measured in detail in Amaranthus retroflexus, Brachiaria texana, and Zea mays. In A. retroflexus and B. texana, the activity ratio declined dramatically below a light intensity of 400 to 500 [mu]mol of photons m-2 s-1. In Z. mays, the activity ratio of Rubisco was relatively insensitive to light intensity compared with the other species. In A. retroflexus, the pool size of ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) declined with reduced light intensity except between 50 and 500 [mu]mol m-2 s-1, when the activity ratio of Rubisco was light dependent. In Z. mays, by contrast, the pool size of RuBP was light dependent only below 350 [mu]mol m-2 s-1. These results indicate that, in response to changes in light intensity, most C4 species regulate Rubisco by reversible carbamylation of catalytic sites, as commonly observed in C3 plants. In a few species, notably Z. mays, Rubisco is not extensively regulated in response to changes in light intensity, possibly because the activity of the CO2 pump may become limiting for photosynthesis at subsaturating light intensity.']",['eng'],,

The aim of this study was to determine the calcium balance of individuals on a vegan diet in comparison with a lactovegetarian diet in a short-term investigation. Seven women and one man, ranging in age from 19 to 24 years, received during the first 10 days a vegan diet based on plant foods and calcium-rich mineral water and a lactovegetarian diet during the following 10 days. Portion size was adapted to the subjects' individual energy requirements. Calcium status was assessed by means of calcium intake in food and calcium output in feces and urine as measured by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. In addition, deoxypyridinoline was measured in urine as a marker of bone resorption. The results show a significantly smaller daily calcium intake with an average of 843 +/- 140 mg in the vegan versus 1322 +/- 303 mg in the lactovegetarian diet. Apparent calcium absorption rates were calculated as 26% +/- 15% in the vegan and 24% +/- 8% in the lactovegetarian group (NS). The calcium balance was positive both in the vegan diet (119 +/- 113 mg/day) and in the lactovegetarian diet (211 +/- 136 mg/day) (NS). Deoxypyridinoline excretion showed no significant difference between the two diets (105 +/- 31 and 98 +/- 23 nmol/day).

All steroids, including progesterone, that display antagonist properties when bound to the wild-type MR are able to activate the mutant receptor (MR(L810)). These findings suggest that progesterone may contribute to the dramatic aggravation of hypertension in MR(L810) carriers during pregnancy. However, the steroid(s) responsible for hypertension in MR(L810) carriers (men and nonpregnant women) has not yet been identified. Here we show that cortisone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone, the main cortisol and corticosterone metabolites produced in the distal nephron, where sodium reabsorption stimulated by aldosterone takes place, bind with high affinity to MR(L810). The potency with which cortisone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone bind to the mutant MR contrasts sharply with their low wild-type MR-binding capacity. In addition, cotransfection assays demonstrate that cortisone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone are potent activators of the MR(L810) trans-activation function. Because the plasma concentration of cortisol in humans is about 30-fold higher than that of corticosterone, these findings strongly suggest that cortisone is one of the endogenous steroids responsible for early-onset hypertension in men and nonpregnant women carrying the MR(L810) mutation.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Aldosterone/metabolism', 'Aldosterone/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'COS Cells', 'Corticosterone/analogs & derivatives', 'Corticosterone/metabolism', 'Corticosterone/pharmacology', 'Cortisone/chemistry', 'Cortisone/metabolism', 'Cortisone/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/chemistry', 'Hydrocortisone/metabolism', 'Hydrocortisone/pharmacology', 'Hypertension/genetics', 'Hypertension/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Point Mutation', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular/physiopathology', 'Receptors, Mineralocorticoid/genetics', 'Receptors, Mineralocorticoid/metabolism']","['Receptors, Mineralocorticoid', 'Aldosterone (4964P6T9RB)', '11-dehydrocorticosterone (FO4V44A3G3)', 'Cortisone (V27W9254FZ)', 'Corticosterone (W980KJ009P)', 'Hydrocortisone (WI4X0X7BPJ)']"

M12563085,['Racial disparity and modifiable risk factors among infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly.'],"['Background!#!Racial disparity in rates of death attributable to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has been observed for many years. Despite decreased SIDS death rates following the ""Back to Sleep"" intervention in 1994, this disparity in death rates has increased. The prone sleep position, unsafe sleep surfaces, and sharing a sleep surface with others (bedsharing) increase the risk of sudden infant death. The race-specific prevalence of these modifiable risk factors in sudden unexpected infant deaths-including SIDS, accidental suffocation (AS), and cause of death undetermined (UD)-has not been investigated in a population-based study. Death rates attributable to AS and UD are also higher in African Americans (AAs) than in other races (non-AA). The potential contribution of unsafe sleep practices to this overall disparity in death rates is uncertain.!##!Objective!#!The objective of this study was to compare death rates attributable to SIDS and related causes of death (AS and UD) in AA and non-AA infants and the prevalence of unsafe sleep practices at time of death. Our hypothesis was that there is a large racial disparity in these modifiable risk factors at the time of death, and that public awareness of this could lead to improved intervention strategies to reduce the disparity in death rates.!##!Methods!#!In this population-based study, we retrospectively reviewed death-scene information and medical examiners\' investigations of deaths in St Louis City and County between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1997. The deaths of all infants <2 years old with the diagnoses of SIDS, AS, or UD were included. Sleep surfaces other than those specifically designed and approved for infant use were termed nonstandard (adult beds, sofas, etc). Denominators for our rate estimates were the number of births (AA and non-AA) in St Louis City and County during the study period.!##!Results!#!The deaths of 119 infants were studied (81 AA and 38 non-AA). SIDS rates were much higher in AA than non-AA infants (2.08 vs 0.65 per 1000 live births), as was the rate of AS (0.47 vs 0.06). There was a trend for increased deaths diagnosed as UD in AA infants (0.36 vs 0.06). Bedsharing deaths were nearly twice as common in AAs (67.1% vs 35.1% of deaths), as were deaths on nonstandard sleep surfaces (79.0% vs 46.0%). Forty-nine percent (49.1%) of all infants who died while bedsharing were found on their backs or sides compared with 20.4% of infants who were not bedsharing. Overall, the fraction of infants found in these nonprone positions was not different for AA infants and non-AA infants (43.3% vs 38.5%). In AA and non-AA infants, factors that greatly increase the risk of bedsharing, such as sofa sharing or all-night bedsharing, were present in all or many bedsharing deaths.!##!Conclusion!#!Among AA infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly, the high prevalence of nonstandard bed use and bedsharing may underlie, in part, their increased death rates. Public health messages tailored for the AA community have stressed first and foremost using nonprone sleep positions. The observation that there was no difference between AA and non-AA infants in position found at death suggests that racial disparity in sleep position is not the most important contributor to racial disparity in death rates. The finding that more infants died on their back or side while bedsharing than otherwise suggests that these sleep positions are less protective when associated with bedsharing. We conclude that public health information tailored for the AA community should give equal emphasis to risks and alternatives to bedsharing as to avoidance of the prone position.']",['eng'],"['African Americans', 'Asphyxia/epidemiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Missouri/epidemiology', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sudden Infant Death/epidemiology', 'Sudden Infant Death/ethnology']",

We describe the chromosomal complement of a novel tumorigenic prostate epithelial cell subline, called M2205, that acquired only three new, consistent chromosomal changes (from those present in the SV40T antigen immortalized parental cell line, P69SV40TAg) when it attained tumor-forming potential. The consistent changes, which were fully characterized using GTG-banding, CBG-banding, silver staining, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), and spectral karyotyping (SKY), involved segmental jumping translocations and resulted in gains in the copy number of genes located on the distal long arm of chromosome 8 (8q22 to 8q24.3), including c-myc. Furthermore, the jumping translocations also resulted in ribosomal genes being present in multiple, tandem copies next to the chromatin from 8q. Given the relatively small number of cytogenetic changes present, this subline provides a means for better understanding the cellular changes associated with the acquired chromosomal imbalances. Further studies of this subline could also provide insight as to the mechanism or mechanisms leading to the formation of jumping translocations, as well as potential position effects resulting from the relocation of ribosomal genes next to other cellular genes or oncogenes.']",['eng'],"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics', 'Epithelial Cells/pathology', 'Gene Amplification/genetics', 'Genes, myc/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",

Sixteen dyslexic and 16 control university students were administered a full battery of psychometric, phonological, auditory, visual and cerebellar tests. Individual data reveal that all 16 dyslexics suffer from a phonological deficit, 10 from an auditory deficit, four from a motor deficit and two from a visual magnocellular deficit. Results suggest that a phonological deficit can appear in the absence of any other sensory or motor disorder, and is sufficient to cause a literacy impairment, as demonstrated by five of the dyslexics. Auditory disorders, when present, aggravate the phonological deficit, hence the literacy impairment. However, auditory deficits cannot be characterized simply as rapid auditory processing problems, as would be predicted by the magnocellular theory. Nor are they restricted to speech. Contrary to the cerebellar theory, we find little support for the notion that motor impairments, when found, have a cerebellar origin or reflect an automaticity deficit. Overall, the present data support the phonological theory of dyslexia, while acknowledging the presence of additional sensory and motor disorders in certain individuals.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Articulation Disorders/complications', 'Auditory Perception', 'Brain Diseases/complications', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Dyslexia/etiology', 'Humans', 'Motion Perception', 'Phonetics', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Psychometrics', 'Speech Perception', 'Vision Disorders/complications', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Perception']",

Ten preterm infants born at 31 weeks mean gestational age (GA) and mean birth weight 1676 g were studied during a routine blood collection in a Level III neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). At 32-week post-conceptional age, computerized physiologic and video recordings were obtained continuously for 60 min (prior to, during and after lance). Motor and facial behaviors were coded independently, using the NIDCAP and the NFCS (Neonatal Facial Coding System), respectively, and compared with heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation responses. Of the movements hypothesized to be stress cues in the NIDCAP model, extension of arms and legs (80%) and finger splay (70%) were the most common following lance. Contrary to the model, most infants (70%) had lower incidence of twitches and startles post-lance compared to baseline. Whereas all infants showed some NFCS response to lance, for three infants, the magnitude was low. HR increased and oxygen saturation decreased post-lance. Infants with more prior pain exposure, lower Apgar, and lower GA at birth, displayed more motor stress cues but less facial activity post-lance. Extension of extremities and finger splay, but not twitches and startles, from the NIDCAP, appear to be stress cues and show promise as clinical pain indicators to supplement facial and physiological pain measures in preterm infants.']",['eng'],"['Child Development', 'Facial Expression', 'Female', 'Fetal Movement/physiology', 'Gestational Age', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Premature/physiology', 'Infant, Premature/psychology', 'Infant, Very Low Birth Weight/physiology', 'Infant, Very Low Birth Weight/psychology', 'Intensive Care, Neonatal', 'Male', 'Pain/etiology', 'Pain/physiopathology', 'Pain/psychology', 'Pain Measurement/methods', 'Stress, Psychological/complications', 'Stress, Psychological/physiopathology', 'Stress, Psychological/psychology', 'Videotape Recording']",

Hypertension was defined as the mean of two blood pressure readings > or = 160/95 mmHg or the use of antihypertensive drugs. The prevalence of epistaxis and hypertension were 14.7% (95% confidence interval, CI 12.7-16.7) and 24.1% (95% CI 21.7-26.6), respectively. History of epistaxis in the adulthood (risk ratio = 1.24, 95% CI 0.83-1.85), and in the previous 6 months (risk ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.40-1.56; p = 0.510) were not associated with hypertension after controlling for gender, age, race, history of allergic rhinitis or nasal abnormalities, alcohol abuse, smoking and years of study.

M12877722,"[""Understanding uncertainty and minimizing families' anxiety at the time of transfer from intensive care.""]","[""When general ward registered nurses (RN) receive patients from an intensive care unit (ICU) they report that much of their time in the initial phases revolves around meeting family needs (Farvis, 2002). Families experience anxiety when leaving the security of the close monitoring seen in ICU (Leith, 1999) and their anxiety reduces their ability to play a key role in the patient's recovery (McShane, 1991; Leske, 1992) as it can impair their decision-making (Cagan, 1988; Halm et al., 1993). By reducing a family's anxiety, they may be more able to cope with the necessary transition to a general ward and support the patient's recovery. A literature search from 1990 onwards was performed within the CINAHL, Medline and Cochrane databases using the key words: intensive care, family, General System Theory, uncertainty, anxiety and transfer. Further articles were retrieved from citation references from the Web of Science or through the reference lists of retrieved literature. Library catalogues were searched using the same key words for books and book chapters. von Bertalanffy's General System Theory provides a framework for understanding the importance of family in a critical illness situation. Critical illness permits little or no time to adapt, thus reducing the family's ability to cope with the situation. Transfer out of ICU is a significant anxiety-producing event for families. Uncertainty in illness is reported in other illness situations to reduce family's adaptation to illness events, but has not been researched with an ICU cohort of families. Seven out of the top 10 needs of ICU families are information needs, highlighting the importance of communication regarding progress and future plans. Nurses require an increased awareness that transfer anxiety exists for families and to be knowledgeable about ways to reduce its occurrence. Research is required to evaluate the efficacy of interventions to reduce anxiety for families and examine the level of uncertainty in illness in this cohort.""]",['eng'],"['Anxiety', 'Communication', 'Critical Care/psychology', 'Critical Illness/psychology', 'Emotions', 'Family/psychology', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Patient Transfer', 'Professional-Family Relations', 'Stress, Physiological/psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Uncertainty']",

The effects of the Buteyko breathing technique, a device which mimics pranayama (a yoga breathing technique), and a dummy pranayama device on bronchial responsiveness and symptoms were compared over 6 months in a parallel group study.!##!Methods!#!Ninety patients with asthma taking an inhaled corticosteroid were randomised after a 2 week run in period to Eucapnic Buteyko breathing, use of a Pink City Lung Exerciser (PCLE) to mimic pranayama, or a PCLE placebo device. Subjects practised the techniques at home twice daily for 6 months followed by an optional steroid reduction phase. Primary outcome measures were symptom scores and change in the dose of methacholine provoking a 20% fall in FEV(1) (PD(20)) during the first 6 months.!##!Results!#!Sixty nine patients (78%) completed the study. There was no significant difference in PD(20) between the three groups at 3 or 6 months. Symptoms remained relatively stable in the PCLE and placebo groups but were reduced in the Buteyko group. Median change in symptom scores at 6 months was 0 (interquartile range -1 to 1) in the placebo group, -1 (-2 to 0.75) in the PCLE group, and -3 (-4 to 0) in the Buteyko group (p=0.003 for difference between groups). Bronchodilator use was reduced in the Buteyko group by two puffs/day at 6 months; there was no change in the other two groups (p=0.005). No difference was seen between the groups in FEV(1), exacerbations, or ability to reduce inhaled corticosteroids.!##!Conclusion!#!The Buteyko breathing technique can improve symptoms and reduce bronchodilator use but does not appear to change bronchial responsiveness or lung function in patients with asthma.

In addition, rosuvastatin is more effective than these statins in allowing patients to reach National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III and Joint European Societies LDL cholesterol goals. The safety profile of rosuvastatin was reviewed (as of April 2003) in 12,569 patients, representing 14,231 patient-years of treatment at doses up to 80 mg. In controlled trials, rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg demonstrated a similar adverse event profile to those for atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg, simvastatin 10 to 80 mg, and pravastatin 10 to 40 mg. Myopathy (defined as muscle symptoms plus serum creatine kinase levels >10 times the upper limit of normal) attributed to rosuvastatin occurred in < or = 0.03% of patients receiving rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg. No cases of rhabdomyolysis occurred in patients receiving rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg. Clinically significant alanine aminotransferase elevations occurred in 0.2% of patients receiving rosuvastatin and those receiving atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin.

Less than 10% of prosthesis recipients have complications develop during their lifetime, commonly as a result of aseptic biomechanical failure, followed by prosthetic joint infection. The pathogenesis of prosthetic joint infection is related to bacteria in biofilms, in which they are protected from antimicrobial killing and host responses rendering these infections difficult to eradicate. Current microbiology laboratory methods for diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection depend on isolation of a pathogen by culture. However, these methods have neither ideal sensitivity nor ideal specificity. Therefore, culture-independent molecular methods have been used to improve the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection. In the research setting, detection of 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction has been used in the molecular diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection. Various antibiofilm strategies directed at disruption of adherent bacteria are the focus of intense research to improve the detection of biofilm organisms and their eradication. In this article, molecular and antibiofilm approaches to prosthetic joint infection are reviewed.']",['eng'],"['Attachment Sites, Microbiological', 'Biofilms/drug effects', 'Biofilms/growth & development', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Drug Contamination', 'Humans', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prosthesis Failure', 'Prosthesis-Related Infections/diagnosis', 'Prosthesis-Related Infections/microbiology', 'Sonication', 'Ultrasonic Therapy']",

To compare the responses of these individuals with those of patients with neurocysticercosis, we screened seropositive persons among family members of 16 patients. We searched for specific antibodies in patients and their 118 households by an enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot assay using specific glycoproteins of T. solium metacestodes. We found six seropositive individuals without neurocysticercosis among members of four families. The matching patients were young, harbored viable cysts, and had short evolution of disease. The baseline response of healthy seropositive individuals was scarce and showed a low frequency of antibodies against glycoproteins GP39-42 and GP24, which are immunodominant in patients with neurocysticercosis. Moreover, they became spontaneously negative in few months. The response of patients was heterogeneous as shown in other studies. The results of this work support a highly dynamic host-parasite immunologic interaction and suggest individual susceptibility or level of exposure among family members.']",['eng'],"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Helminth/immunology', 'Brain Diseases/epidemiology', 'Brain Diseases/etiology', 'Brain Diseases/immunology', 'Child', 'Family', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/immunology', 'Male', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neurocysticercosis/epidemiology', 'Neurocysticercosis/etiology', 'Neurocysticercosis/immunology', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Taenia/immunology']","['Antigens, Helminth', 'Immunodominant Epitopes']"

Residents were classified as depressed if their score on the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) exceeded 7.!##!Results!#!Using this criterion, 13% were depressed, and only 18% of those were on antidepressants. Over one-third of residents had symptoms of depression, such as anxious expression, rumination, or worrying, and 25% displayed sad voice, sad expression, or tearfulness. Depression was significantly associated with medical comorbidity, social withdrawal, psychosis, agitation, and length of residence in the facility. Depressed residents were discharged to nursing homes at 1.5 times the rate of nondepressed residents. Rates of mortality were also higher for depressed residents, but only those with severe depression (CSDD >12) had a statistically significant increased rate of death.!##!Conclusion!#!The mission of assisted living is to help older adults retain autonomy, privacy, and quality of life in a personalized environment.

The precise function of the ALDP (ALD protein) still remains unclear. Aldp deficiency in mammals and Bgm deficiency in Drosophila led to accumulation of VLCFAs (very long-chain fatty acids). As a first step towards studying this interaction in wild-type versus Aldp-deficient mice, we analysed the expression pattern of the murine orthologue of the Bgm gene. In contrast with the ubiquitously expressed Ald gene, Bgm expression is restricted to the tissues that are affected by X-ALD such as brain, testis and adrenals. During mouse brain development, Bgm mRNA was first detected by Northern-blot analysis on embryonic day 18 and increased steadily towards adulthood, whereas the highest level of Ald mRNA was found on embryonic day 12 and decreased gradually during differentiation. Protein fractionation and confocal laser imaging of Bgm-green fluorescent protein fusion proteins revealed a microsomal localization that was different from peroxisomes (where Aldp is detected), endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. Mouse Bgm showed acyl-CoA synthetase activity towards a VLCFA substrate in addition to LCFAs, and this activity was enriched in the microsomal compartment. Speculating that Bgm expression could be regulated by Ald deficiency, we compared the abundance of Bgm mRNA in wild-type and Ald knockout mice but observed no difference. Although mouse Bgm is capable of activating VLCFA, we conclude that a direct interaction between the mouse Bgm and the Aldp seems unlikely.']",['eng'],"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics', 'Animals', 'Brain/embryology', 'Brain/growth & development', 'Brain/metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Coenzyme A Ligases/analysis', 'Coenzyme A Ligases/genetics', 'Coenzyme A Ligases/metabolism', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Components', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microsomes/enzymology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Tissue Distribution']","['Drosophila Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Coenzyme A Ligases (EC 6.2.1.-)', 'lipidosin (EC 6.2.1.-)', 'FAA2 protein, S cerevisiae (EC 6.2.1.3)', 'bgm protein, Drosophila (EC 6.2.1.3)', 'long-chain-fatty-acid-CoA ligase (EC 6.2.1.3)']"

Unlike other variants of blue nevus, which primarily are composed of pigmented, spindle-shaped melanocytes, EBN is characterized by large, well-defined, heavily-pigmented polygonal or epithelioid-shaped melanocytes intermixed with less densely pigmented epithelioid- and fusiform-shaped melanocytes.

We then suggest that discrepancies in their findings can partly be overcome by functional neuroimaging studies of patients with acquired dyslexia. We present two such studies. One patient had a large left temporoparietal lesion which limited his reading to words with high semantic associations. When he read these words aloud, activation was observed in all areas of the normal reading system with the exception of the damaged left superior temporal lobe. The second patient had anterior temporal lobe atrophy with semantic dementia and a deficit in reading words that rely on lexical or semantic mediation. When asked to read aloud words on which she was likely to succeed, she activated all the normal areas, with increased activation in a left sensorimotor area associated with phonological processing and decreased activation in several areas associated with semantic processing. By relating these findings to those from lesion studies and imaging studies of normals, we propose that the translation of orthography to phonology is mediated semantically by the anterior part of the left midfusiform gyrus. In contrast, when semantic processing is compromised, the translation of orthography to phonology will be more reliant on the posterior part of the left midfusiform and the left frontal areas associated with phonology. Future studies are required to examine the connectivity between these areas during normal and abnormal reading.']",['eng'],"['Brain/anatomy & histology', 'Brain/physiology', 'Brain/physiopathology', 'Brain Diseases/pathology', 'Brain Mapping/methods', 'Cognition', 'Diagnostic Imaging/methods', 'Humans', 'Models, Neurological']",

ETF is the intermediate electron carrier between the dehydrogenases and ETF-QO. The steady-state kinetic constants of human ETF-QO were determined with ubiquinone homologues and analogues that contained saturated n-alkyl substituents at the 6 position. These experiments show that optimal substrates contain a ten-carbon-atom side chain, consistent with a preliminary crystal structure that shows that only the first two of ten isoprene units of co-enzyme Q10 (CoQ10) interact with the protein. Derivatives with saturated alkyl side chains are very good substrates, indicating that, unlike other ubiquinone oxidoreductases, there is little preference for the methyl branches or rigidity of the CoQ side chain. Few of the compounds that inhibit ubiquinone oxidoreductases inhibit ETF-QO. Compounds found to act as inhibitors of ETF-QO include 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide, a naphthoquinone analogue, 2-(3-methylpentyl)-4,6-dinitrophenol and pentachlorophenol. 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone (DBMIB), which inhibits the mitochondrial bc1 complex and the chloroplast b6 f complex in redox-dependent fashion, can serve as an electron acceptor for human ETF-QO. The observation of simple Michaelis-Menten kinetic patterns and a single type of quinone-binding site, determined by fluorescence titrations of the protein with DBMIB and 6-(10-bromodecyl)ubiquinone, are consistent with one ubiquinone-binding site per ETF-QO monomer.']",['eng'],"['Electron-Transferring Flavoproteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/metabolism', 'Quinones/chemistry', 'Quinones/metabolism', 'Quinones/pharmacology', 'Ubiquinone/analogs & derivatives']","['Electron-Transferring Flavoproteins', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins', 'Quinones', 'Ubiquinone (1339-63-5)', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors (EC 1.5.-)', 'electron-transferring-flavoprotein dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.5.1)']"

M14719718,['Psychological aspects of interventional therapy.'],"['This discussion is not, nor could it hope to be, an exhaustive examination of all of the various interventional therapies. Instead, it is intended to highlight the potential contribution of psychosocial factors. These factors may vary to some degree or another depending on the specific procedure, but clearly play a role whenever the desired outcome involves a reduction in subjective pain, alteration in the adaptiveness with which the patient responds to the experience of pain, and quality of life. Many notables, including Dr. Michael Cousins, have echoed the importance of incorporating interventional therapies into an interdisciplinary approach. Yet, there seems to be a preponderance of ""block shops"". Even when used for diagnostic or prognostic purposes, the impact of psychosocial variables and the potential relevance of a meaningful behavioral or psychologic evaluation cannot be overstated. It is easy to understand how the reader might conclude that immersing oneself in the minutiae of all these variables could lead to a feeling of intellectual paralysis when it comes to evaluating the data and arriving at a conclusion or diagnosis. However, ignoring these psychosocial variables and their complex interaction does not constitute a solution. This is particularly true in considering discography where, depending on the criteria applied, the percent of ""false positives"" can vary from 0% to as much as 40%. The implication for the performing of ""unnecessary"" spine surgery is obvious. The thoughtful practitioner will be mindful of the role of psychosocial variables in so far as they are thought to be relevant in a particular case. The overall contribution of psychosocial variables to the application of interventional therapies for the diagnosis and treatment of pain can be overlooked and ignored, but not denied. A certain percentage of patients will respond in a predictable, desirable or positive fashion purely on a statistical basis. Historically, and there seems to be no reason to believe this will change in the immediate future, the degree to which the psychosocial variables are considered is left up to the interventionalist. Some are content to perform a directed procedure or therapy concerned only, and sometimes to a less than sufficient degree, with the technical adequacy of the procedure. Others will appreciate the role of human factors including those of the practitioner and patient alike, and strive not only for a statistically derived outcome but the best possible outcome for a given patient. Psychosocial factors can sometimes take on the character of ""nuisance variables"". However, it is hard not to wonder how much care each would want to have given to these factors if one were on the other end of the needle.']",['eng'],"['Disease Management', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pain/classification', 'Pain/psychology', 'Pain Management']",

These guidelines are derived from the original procedural manual that consisted of protocol charts. The charts provide the pharmacist including ICU staff members with directions for the collection of clinical information and the forms to use for documentation. We focused on appropriate collection and proper preservation of collected samples in order to perform diagnostic analysis when needed. The original Information Record Form, completed by the participating pharmacist, documents all information regarding the patient\'s care. This record provides for integration of the diverse and complicated clinical information of the patient so that the physician can gain a comprehensive picture of the patient. The guidelines, manual book, materials for sample collection and the Information Record Form are stored in a container called the ""Poisoning Aid Set"", which will be available in the ICU. The guidelines are activated once an emergency call from paramedics is received regarding a suspected poisoning patient. According to the guidelines, the emergency room (ER) physician immediately contacts the pharmacist who will provide his professional services as a member of the treatment team. We have applied these guidelines to 29 poisoning patients and have critically evaluated for effectiveness. Early participation by pharmacists, by reviewing timely, accurate and competent clinical information enabled the pharmacist to identify the suspected drug from the biological samples obtained. From our experiences, we conclude that this active involvement of pharmacist in the initial treatment of poisoning and overdosed patients in the ICU was both supportive and beneficial to the patient. In addition, the participation of pharmacist as a member of a treatment team provided an excellent opportunity to collaborate with the entire ICU staff members.']",['jpn'],"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Drug Information Services', 'Drug Overdose/diagnosis', 'Drug Overdose/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Patient Care Team', 'Pharmacists', 'Poisoning/diagnosis', 'Poisoning/therapy', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic']",

In 80 per cent of cases in which there was gross blood in the stools before the third day of hospitalization, Shigella grew on cultures. No gross blood was noted in 27 per cent of cases in which Shigella was demonstrated.3. The cases in which Shigella was demonstrated did not differ greatly from the others with regard to fever, leukocytosis, or response to therapy.4. Salmonella organisms were not grown on cultures in any case.5. Most of the patients were infants younger than one year of age.6. Poor socio-economic and hygienic conditions characterized the households from which these county hospital patients came.7. Household follow-up studies indicated that there had been one or more instances of diarrhea among household associates of approximately half the hospitalized patients at some time during the month prior to admission.']",['eng'],"['Diarrhea', 'Feces', 'Female', 'Fever', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Seasons', 'Shigella']",

Use of the labelled drugs enabled direct observations of the ionization equilibrium of the N-dimethyl group. A second derivative spectrophotometric study proved that 95-98% of the phenothiazine species in the sample solutions (200 microM phenothiazine in the presence of 27 mM PC SUV) were incorporated into the PC bilayer, which simplified the calculation of pKm values by allowing that the phenothiazines in the aqueous phase could be neglected. The pKm values were calculated from the chemical shift dependence of the N-dimethyl 13C NMR signal on the pH value of sample solutions. The pKm values obtained were smaller than those measured in aqueous solutions by about one unit. The existence of cholesterol (30 mol%) in the PC bilayer showed little effect on the pKm values, suggesting that cholesterol in the bilayer does not largely affect the interfacial region where the N-dimethyl group of the incorporated phenothiazines is located. The results offered clear evidence for the pKm decrease and provided their precise values.']",['eng'],"['Carbon Isotopes', 'Chlorpromazine/chemistry', 'Cholesterol/chemistry', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Lipid Bilayers/chemistry', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/methods', 'Phenothiazines/chemistry', 'Phosphatidylcholines/chemistry', 'Titrimetry', 'Triflupromazine/chemistry']","['Carbon Isotopes', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Phenothiazines', 'Phosphatidylcholines', 'Cholesterol (97C5T2UQ7J)', 'Triflupromazine (RO16TQF95Y)', 'Chlorpromazine (U42B7VYA4P)']"

Aquatica gigantea) canopy during two growing seasons. An additional aim of this study was to determine how nitrogen is partitioned in the canopy and whether Rubisco and chlorophyll serve as sources of nitrogen. During both growing seasons, the total activity and the amount of Rubisco were high in young, sun-exposed leaves and decreased as the leaves aged and became shaded. In 1985, the specific activity was low (on average 0.8 micromol mm(-1) mg(-1) Rubisco protein) compared with the values obtained in 1986 (on average 1.8 micromol min(-1) mg(-1) Rubisco protein). These differences in the specific activity of Rubisco between the two years might be associated with changes in partitioning of nitrogen. During the cool summer of 1985, about 20% of the total nitrogen was partitioned to Rubisco compared with about 13% during the warm summer of 1986. Rubisco comprised a high proportion (about 60%) of the total soluble protein throughout the 1985 growing season, whereas during the 1986 growing season, the proportion of Rubisco in the total soluble protein fraction was lower and decreased markedly as the leaves became shaded. Chlorophyll did not serve as a source of nitrogen in the canopy. On the contrary, the proportion of total nitrogen in chlorophyll increased with time, which indicates acclimation of the thylakoid membranes to decreasing irradiance. The degree of activation of Rubisco in samples collected in 1986 was high in young, sun-exposed leaves, which suggests that in these leaves, Rubisco may limit the rate of CO(2) uptake. In the shaded leaves of the lower canopy, the degree of activation of Rubisco was low, which indicates that in these leaves, photosynthesis is limited by factors other than Rubisco.']",['eng'],,

Relative to other statins, rosuvastatin possesses a greater number of binding interactions with HMG-CoA reductase and has a high affinity for the active site of the enzyme. Rosuvastatin is relatively hydrophilic and is selectively taken up by, and active in, hepatic cells. Rosuvastatin has the longest terminal half-life of the statins and is only minimally metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP 450) enzyme system with no significant involvement of the 3A4 enzyme. Consistent with this finding is the absence of clinically significant drug interactions between rosuvastatin and other drugs known to inhibit CYP 450 enzymes. In patients with hypercholesterolemia, rosuvastatin 10-40 mg has been shown to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels by 52-63%, as well as increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels by up to 14% and reduce triglycerides (TG) by up to 28%. Studies have shown that rosuvastatin is superior to atorvastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin in reducing LDL-C and favorably modifying other components of the atherogenic lipid profile. The significant decreases in LDL-C with rosuvastatin treatment should help to improve attainment of lipid goals and reduce the requirement for dose titration. In addition, the effects of rosuvastatin on HDL-C and TG levels will be of benefit in treating patients with abnormalities such as mixed dyslipidemia and the metabolic syndrome. Rosuvastatin is well tolerated, with a safety profile comparable with that of other currently available statins.']",['eng'],"['Drug Interactions', 'Fluorobenzenes/pharmacology', 'Fluorobenzenes/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Hyperlipidemias/drug therapy', 'Metabolic Syndrome/drug therapy', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Rosuvastatin Calcium', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']","['Fluorobenzenes', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines', 'Sulfonamides', 'Rosuvastatin Calcium (83MVU38M7Q)']"

M15038367,['Cerebral modeling and dynamic Bayesian networks.'],"[""The understanding and the prediction of the clinical outcomes of focal or degenerative cerebral lesions, as well as the assessment of rehabilitation procedures, necessitate knowing the cerebral substratum of cognitive or sensorimotor functions. This is achieved by activation studies, where subjects are asked to perform a specific task while data of their brain functioning are obtained through functional neuroimaging techniques. Such studies, as well as animal experiments, have shown that sensorimotor or cognitive functions are the offspring of the activity of large-scale networks of anatomically connected cerebral regions. However, no one-to-one correspondence between activated networks adn functions can be found. Our research aims at understanding how the activation of large-scale networks derives from cerebral information processing mechanisms, which can only explain apparently conflicting activation data. Our work falls at the crossroads of neuroimaging interpretation techniques and computational neuroscience. Since knowledge in cognitive neuroscience is permanently evolving, our research aims more precisely at defining a new modeling formalism and at building a flexible simulator, allowing a quick implementation of the models, for a better interpretation of cerebral functional images. It also aims at providing plausible models, at eht level of large-scale networks, of cerebral information processing mechanisms in humans. In this paper, we propose a formalism, based on dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs), that respects the following constraints: an oriented, networks architecture, whose nodes (the cerebral structures) can all be different, the implementation of causality--the activation of the structure is caused by upstream nodes' activation--the explicit representation of different time scales (from 1 ms for the cerebral activity to many seconds for a PET scan image acquisition), the representation of cerebral information at the integrated level of neuronal populations, the imprecision of functional neuroimaging data, the nonlinearity and the uncertainty in cerebral mechanisms, and brain's plasticity (learning, reorganization, modulation). One of the main problems, nonlinearity, has been tackled thanks to new extensions of the Kalman filter. The capabilities of the formalism's current version are illustrated by the modeling of a phoneme categorization process, explaining the different cerebral activations in normal and dyslexic subjects.""]",['eng'],"['Bayes Theorem', 'Brain Diseases/pathology', 'Brain Diseases/rehabilitation', 'Brain Injuries/pathology', 'Brain Injuries/rehabilitation', 'Cerebral Cortex/physiology', 'Cognition Disorders/etiology', 'Cognition Disorders/rehabilitation', 'Dyslexia', 'Humans', 'Prognosis', 'Tomography, Emission-Computed']",

Control (14) and experimental (16) infants were assessed at 2 weeks' and 9 months' corrected age on health status, growth, and neurobehavior, and at 2 weeks' corrected age additionally on electroencephalogram spectral coherence, magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging, and measurements of transverse relaxation time.!##!Results!#!The groups were medically and demographically comparable before as well as after the treatment. However, the experimental group showed significantly better neurobehavioral functioning, increased coherence between frontal and a broad spectrum of mainly occipital brain regions, and higher relative anisotropy in left internal capsule, with a trend for right internal capsule and frontal white matter. Transverse relaxation time showed no difference. Behavioral function was improved also at 9 months' corrected age. The relationship among the 3 neurodevelopmental domains was significant. The results indicated consistently better function and more mature fiber structure for experimental infants compared with their controls.!##!Conclusions!#!This is the first in vivo evidence of enhanced brain function and structure due to the NIDCAP.

It is generally accepted that the social, psychological, emotional and developmental needs of children are best met at home, rather than in a hospital environment, and this applies equally to children who have long-term health problems. However, one of the many factors that can impede the discharge from hospital of children requiring long-term assisted ventilation is a lack of staff who can provide care and support for them and their families. Increasing the number of staff who are able to provide such support may therefore assist in improving the provision of appropriate care for this group.

However, no test is 100% accurate in its assessment of ADHD. This study introduces a stochastic assessment combining psychometric tests with previously reported (Consistency Index) and newly developed (Alpha Blockade Index) EEG-based physiological markers of ADHD. The assessment utilizes classical Bayesian inference to refine after each step the probability of ADHD of each individual. In a pilot study involving six college females with ADHD and six matched controls, the assessment achieved correct classification for all ADHD and non-ADHD participants. In comparison, the classification of ADHD versus non-ADHD participants was < 85% for any one of the tests separately. The procedure significantly improved the score separation between ADHD versus non-ADHD groups. The final average probabilities for ADHD were 76% for the ADHD group and 8% for the control group. These probabilities correlated (r = .87) with the Brown ADD scale and (r = .84) with the ADHD-Symptom Inventory used for the screening of the participants. We conclude that, although each separate test was not completely accurate, a combination of several tests classified correctly all ADHD and all non-ADHD participants. The application of the proposed assessment is not limited to the specific tests used in this study--the assessment represents a general paradigm capable of accommodating a variety of ADHD tests into a single diagnostic assessment.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/diagnosis', 'Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/physiopathology', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Electroencephalography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Pilot Projects', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Psychometrics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",

Use of SCE jumping for generating transposon insertion mutants is anticipated to be widely applicable to other bacterial organisms.

Epidemiological evidence from large-cohort studies confirms endometriosis as an independent risk factor for ovarian cancer. Further circumstantial evidence for this link was found in the common risk factors for ovarian cancer and endometriosis. These risk factors influence retrograde menstruation and endometriosis in the same positive or negative way. Based on data in the literature, the prevalence of endometriosis in epithelial ovarian cancer has been calculated to be 4.5, 1.4, 35.9, and 19.0% for serous, mucinous, clear-cell and endometrioid ovarian carcinoma, respectively. The risk of malignant transformation in ovarian endometriosis was calculated at 2.5% but this might be an underestimate. In addition, some authors described atypical endometriosis in a spatial and chronological association with ovarian cancer. Finally, molecular studies have detected common alterations in endometriosis and ovarian cancer. These data suggest that some tumours, especially endometrioid and clear-cell carcinomas, can arise from endometriosis. Moreover, endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer represents a distinct clinical entity, with a more favourable biological behaviour, given a lower stage distribution and better survival than non-endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer.']",['eng'],"['Adenocarcinoma, Clear Cell/etiology', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Endometrioid/etiology', 'Endometriosis/complications', 'Endometriosis/epidemiology', 'Estrogen Replacement Therapy/adverse effects', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/etiology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/etiology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics', 'Prognosis']",

In the assessment we employed the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Revised (WPPSI-R) for cognition, Movement Assessment Battery for Children (Movement ABC) for motor function, subtests of the NEPSY test battery for attention and distractibility, and the WHO definitions of impairment, disability and handicap.

The baseline study in 1990 identified 200 prevalent cases of dementia. The dementia-free cohort included 1,260 persons aged 75 and over. This was the sample used for the incidence study. We rescreened and selectively reexamined this group in 1995 using a two-phase procedure consisting of a screening interview at home using the MMSE. Diagnoses of dementia, AD and VaD were established using the Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of the Elderly for surviving participants. For deceased participants, we used the Retrospective Collateral Dementia Interview to establish a diagnosis of dementia and AD according to DSM-III-R diagnostic criteria.!##!Results!#!Information was obtained for 91% of the subjects at risk; 122 incident cases of dementia were identified. Incidence rates per 1,000 person-years at risk were 23.2 (95% CI = 19.1-27.3) for dementia, 10.8 (95% CI = 7.8-13.7) for AD and 9.5 (95% CI = 6.7-12.1) for VaD. All dementia subtypes showed an age-dependent pattern. Females had a relative risk of 1.8 (95% CI = 1.0-3.4) to develop AD. The inclusion of deceased cases with manifestations of dementia increased the rate of dementia incidence in 7.1 cases/1,000 person-years at risk.!##!Conclusion!#!Incidence rates were similar to those reported by other cohort studies. All dementia subtypes increased with age, but incidence rates did not increase exponentially in the oldest old. Females were at increased risk for AD. The inclusion of information about dementia symptoms from relatives of deceased participants was useful in order to avoid underestimation of the dementia incidence rates. Underestimation of the incidence rates was more important in those aged 75-84 years.""]",['eng'],"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alzheimer Disease/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dementia/epidemiology', 'Dementia, Vascular/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Rural Population', 'Spain/epidemiology']",

The objective was to define the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and environmental risk factors of specific aeroallergen sensitization in pediatric allergic rhinitis patients in this unique environment. The method adopted was a retrospective analysis of allergic rhinitis patients, undergoing aeroallergen skin prick testing (SPT), in the outpatient specialty clinic of the KK Children's hospital, from July 2001 to June 2002. A total of 202 patients were included, 161 (80%) males, 167 (83%) Chinese, age mean 7.6 yr (range 2-14 yr). The most prevalent clinical symptoms were: watery rhinorrhea 61%, blocked nose 61%, sneezing 52%, snoring 17%, and epistaxis 12%. SPT results were positive for house dust mites in 97% of children, pets (20%), molds (19%), pollens (15%), and kapok (10%). Mold sensitization was significantly more prevalent in households without air-conditioning (aircon), 49% vs. 10% with aircon (odds ratio 9.4, 95% CI 3.8-22.9). Polysensitization (sensitization to three or more allergens) was similarly more prevalent in households without aircon, 51% vs. 14% with aircon (odds ratio 6.4, 95% CI 2.8-14.7). It was concluded that indoor aeroallergen sensitization is the major associated factor with clinical allergic rhinitis in children in Singapore.

The present study investigated R-States and stress symptom-patterns associated with listening to Mozart versus New Age music. Students (N = 63) were divided into three relaxation groups based on previously determined preferences. Fourteen listened to a 28-minute tape recording of Mozart\'s Eine Kleine Nachtmusik and 14 listened to a 28-minute tape of Steven Halpern\'s New Age Serenity Suite. Others (n = 35) did not want music and instead chose a set of popular recreational magazines. Participants engaged in their relaxation activity at home for three consecutive days for 28 minutes a session. Before and after each session, each person completed the Smith Relaxation States Inventory (Smith, 2001), a comprehensive questionnaire tapping 15 R-States as well as the stress states of somatic stress, worry, and negative emotion. Results revealed no differences at Session 1. At Session 2, those who listened to Mozart reported higher levels of At Ease/Peace and lower levels of Negative Emotion. Pronounced differences emerged at Session 3. Mozart listeners uniquely reported substantially higher levels of Mental Quiet, Awe and Wonder, and Mystery. Mozart listeners reported higher levels, and New Age listeners slightly elevated levels, of At Ease/Peace and Rested/Refreshed. Both Mozart and New Age listeners reported higher levels of Thankfulness and Love. In summary, those who listened to Mozart\'s Eine Kleine Nachtmusik reported more psychological relaxation and less stress than either those who listened to New Age music or read popular recreational magazines. Results suggest the usefulness of ABC relaxation theory in comparing the different effects of music and relaxation techniques.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Attention', 'Cognition', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Music', 'Music Therapy/methods', 'Psychological Theory', 'Relaxation', 'Social Behavior', 'Stress, Psychological/therapy']",

Moreover, disturbance of effective communication can cause neurological symptoms like apraxia, dyslexia or object agnosia. Interregional communication can be assessed by coherence analysis of synchronized neuronal oscillations, and has been referred to as synchrony or ""binding"". The concept of synchrony as a means of information coding is attractive, but its functional relevance has been challenged. We hypothesized that if synchrony is functionally relevant in humans, then more synchrony should determine better behavioral performance. Here, we show in a visuotactile integration task that the amount of low-frequency (7-13Hz), long-range electroencephalographic coherence between visual and sensorimotor cortex is significantly correlated with the level of performance. Trials with highest coherences were the most successful ones and vice versa in the absence of differences in regional activation measured as task-related spectral power. In summary, quantitatively linking the amount of long-range synchrony with the degree of behavioral success in humans, the present data suggest that the ability to generate topographically specific synchrony of high amplitude is functionally relevant for behavioral success. They also raise the possibility that the magnitude of regional activation is less representative of the efficacy of brain functioning than interregional synchrony.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Brain Mapping/methods', 'Electroencephalography/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Motor Cortex/physiology', 'Psychomotor Performance/physiology', 'Somatosensory Cortex/physiology', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Task Performance and Analysis', 'Touch/physiology', 'Visual Cortex/physiology', 'Visual Perception/physiology']",

Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured hourly for 6 hours, beginning at 9:30 am on day 1 (untreated baseline), days 6 and 7 (single-agent therapy), and days 13 and 14 (2-drug combination therapy). On days 2 through 7, 1 drop of the scheduled single agent was given immediately after the 9:30 am IOP measurement, and on days 8 through 14, the second scheduled drug was given 5 minutes after the first. The following 5 different dosing protocols were studied: latanoprost with bimatoprost added, bimatoprost with latanoprost added, latanoprost with travoprost added, travoprost with latanoprost added, and latanoprost with a second dose of latanoprost added.!##!Results!#!There were no statistically significant (P =.95) differences among the mean baseline IOPs in any of the 5 treatment groups. When applied as single agents, latanoprost, bimatoprost, and travoprost all produced significant (P<.05) and equivalent (P =.98) reductions in IOP. The mean +/-SEM maximum reduction (P<.05) from baseline IOP was 7.0 +/- 0.4 mm Hg (20% reduction) with travoprost alone, 6.5 +/- 1.6 mm Hg (18%) with bimatoprost alone, and 7.5 +/- 1.0 mm Hg (22%) with latanoprost alone. The mean +/-SEM maximum additive reductions in IOP were 3.0 +/- 0.6 mm Hg (P<.05) for travoprost added to latanoprost; 2.0 +/- 0.4 mm Hg (P<.05) for latanoprost added to travoprost; 4.8 +/- 1.3 mm Hg (P<.05) for bimatoprost added to latanoprost; 4.3 +/- 0.6 mm Hg (P<.05) for latanoprost added to bimatoprost; and 0.3 +/- 0.5 mm Hg (P>.60) for latanoprost added to itself.

The IOP effects of the commercial concentrations of bimatoprost or travoprost were additive to that of latanoprost, with bimatoprost showing a greater additive response than travoprost.

Chromosome 1 instability generally involves partial duplications, whole-arm translocations, or jumping translocations of 1q, identified by G-banding. To characterize this instability further, we performed spectral karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization with probes for satII/III (1q12), BCL9 (1q21), and IL6R (1q21) on the karyotypes of 44 patients with known 1q aberrations. In eight patients, segmental duplication of 1q12-21 and adjacent bands occurred on nonhomologous chromosomes. In five cases, the 1q first jumped to a nonhomologous chromosome, after which the 1q12-21 segment again duplicated itself 1-3 times. In three other cases, segmental duplications occurred after the 1q first jumped to a nonhomologous chromosome, where the proximal adjacent nonhomologous chromosome segment was duplicated prior to the 1q jumping or inserting itself into a new location. These cases demonstrate that satII/III DNA sequences are not only associated not only with the duplication of adjacent distal chromosome segments after translocation, but are also associated with the duplication and jumping/insertion of proximal nonhomologous chromosome segments. We have designated this type of instability as a jumping segmental duplication.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication', 'Genomic Instability/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics']",

Although some evidence suggests that using specific features of buildings and their immediate surroundings such as stairs can have a meaningful impact on health, the influences of the physical environment on physical activity at the building and site scale are not yet clear. While there is some research suggesting that people will be more active in buildings that have visible, accessible, pleasing, and supportive features, such as motivational point-of-decision prompts and well-designed stairs, there is only limited evidence to support that assertion. This paper reviews the available evidence linking design and site decisions to physical activity, and suggests a framework for connecting research and implementation strategies for creating activity-friendly buildings. In consideration of the kinds of physical activities associated with buildings and their sites, it is proposed that the form of buildings and sites affect physical activity at several spatial scales: the selection and design of sites with respect to a building's location on its site and within its immediate community and the provision and layout of site amenities; building design such as the programming, layout, and form of the building; and building element design such as the design and layout of elements such as stairs or exercise rooms.

M15698926,['Contextual influence of TMS on the latency of saccades and vergence.'],"['This study examines the effects of TMS of the right PPC on the latency of saccades and vergence alone or combined and the role of experimental design. Two designs were used: pure blocks with exclusively no-TMS or TMS trials; mixed blocks in which no-TMS and TMS trials were interleaved; a control study with TMS of the primary motor cortex (pure blocks) was also conducted and showed no effects on latencies. In contrast, in the experiment with TMS of the PPC latencies for TMS trials increased relative to no-TMS trials for almost all eye movements (isolated saccades, convergence, divergence, and for saccade and divergence components of combined eye movements). However, such increase was significant for pure blocks only. In mixed blocks no difference between TMS and no-TMS was found mainly because the latency of no-TMS trials increased relative to corresponding latencies in pure blocks. A second study centered on isolated convergence and divergence confirmed the interaction between block-design and TMS effects, and showed significant TMS/no-TMS differences only for the pure design and for a design in which the rate of TMS trials was high (75%). Again, the absence of difference was due to increase of latency for no-TMS trials in mixed blocks with low rates of TMS trials (50% or 25%), but also to decreased effects for the TMS trials themselves. We conclude that latency of all eye movements, saccades and vergence is highly influenced by the context. Such a contextual factor is the number of TMS versus no-TMS trials within a block; low numbers of TMS trials (50% or less) increases baseline latencies. The design of mixed blocks with 50% or less of TMS trials should not be recommended as it underestimates the direct effects of TMS on cortical processing.

M15725350,['Transitions in care during the end of life: changes experienced following enrolment in a comprehensive palliative care program.'],"['BACKGROUND: Transitions in the location of care and in who provides such care can be extremely stressful for individuals facing death and for those close to them. The objective of this study was to describe the distribution of transitions in care experienced by palliative care patients following admission to a comprehensive palliative care program (PCP). A better understanding of these transitions may aid in reducing unnecessary change, help predict care needs, enhance transitions that improve quality of life, guide health care system communication links and maximize the cost-effective utilization of different care settings and providers. METHODS: Transition and demographic information pertaining to all patients registered in the PCP at the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre (QEII), Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2002 and who died on or prior to December 31, 2002 was extracted from the PCP database and examined. A transition was defined as either: (1) a change in location of where the patient was cared for by the PCP or, (2) a change in which clinical service provided care. Descriptive analysis provided frequencies and locations of transitions experienced from time of PCP admission to death and during the final two and four weeks of life, an examination of patient movement and a summary of the length of stay spent by patients at each care location. RESULTS: Over the five year period, 3974 adults admitted to the QEII PCP experienced a total of 5903 transitions (Mean 1.5; standard deviation 1.8; median 1). Patients with no transitions (28%) differed significantly from those who had experienced at least one transition with respect to survival time, age, location of death and diagnosis (p < 0.0001). The majority of patients were admitted to the PCP from various acute care units (66%). Although 54% of all transitions were made to the home, only 60% of these moves included care provided by PCP staff. During the last four weeks of life, 47% of patients experienced at least one transition; 36% during the final two weeks of life. Shorter stays in each location were evident when care was actively provided by the PCP. CONCLUSION: A relatively small number of patients under the care of the PCP at the end of life, made several transitions in care setting or service provider. These particular patients need closer scrutiny to understand why such transitions take place so that clinical programs may be designed or modified to minimize the transitions themselves or the impact transitions have on patients and families.']",['eng'],,

M15766272,"['Dynamics of glutathione conjugation and conjugate efflux in detoxification of the carcinogen, 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide: contributions of glutathione, glutathione S-transferase, and MRP1.']","['4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide (NQO) is a reactive electrophile with potent cytotoxic as well as genotoxic activities. NQO forms a conjugate, QO-SG, with glutathione, which greatly reduces its chemical reactivity. Previous studies demonstrated that glutathione S-transferase (GST) P1a-1a and multidrug resistance protein (MRP) 1/2 act in synergy to confer resistance to both cyto- and genotoxicities of NQO, whereas protection afforded by GSTP1a-1a or MRP alone was much less. To better understand the role of glutathione, GSTP1a-1a, and MRP1 in NQO detoxification, we have characterized the kinetics and cofactor requirements of MRP1-mediated transport of QO-SG and NQO. Additionally, using recombinant GSTP1a-1a and physiological conditions, we have examined the enzymatic and nonenzymatic formation of QO-SG. Results show that MRP1 supports efficient transport of QO-SG with a K(m) of 9.5 microM and a V(max) comparable to other good MRP1 substrates. Glutathione or its S-methyl analogue enhanced the rate of (3)H-QO-SG transport, whereas QO-SG inhibited the rate of (3)H-glutathione transport. These data favor a mechanism for glutathione-enhanced, MRP1-mediated QO-SG transport that does not involve cotransport of glutathione. NQO was not transported by MRP1 either alone or in the presence of S-methyl glutathione. Transport of (3)H-NQO was observed in the presence of glutathione, but uptake into MRP1-containing vesicles was entirely attributable to its conjugate, QO-SG, formed nonenzymatically. While the nonenzymatic rate was readily measurable, enzyme catalysis was overwhelmingly dominant in the presence of GSTP1a-1a (rate enhancement factor, (k(cat)/K(m))/k(2), approximately 3 x 10(6)). We conclude that MRP1 supports detoxification of NQO via efficient, glutathione-stimulated efflux of QO-SG. While nonenzymatic QO-SG formation and MRP1-mediated conjugate efflux result in low-level protection from cyto- and genotoxicities, this protection is greatly enhanced by coexpression of GSTP1-1 with MRP1. This result emphasizes the quantitative importance of enzyme-catalyzed conjugate formation, a crucial determinant of high-level, MRP-dependent protection of cells from NQO toxicity.']",['eng'],"['4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide/metabolism', '4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide/toxicity', 'Carcinogens/metabolism', 'Carcinogens/toxicity', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Glutathione/chemistry', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glutathione/physiology', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi', 'Glutathione Transferase/chemistry', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/physiology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Inactivation, Metabolic', 'Isoenzymes/chemistry', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/chemistry', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/physiology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Temperature', 'Thermodynamics', 'Transport Vesicles/chemistry', 'Transport Vesicles/metabolism']","['Carcinogens', 'Isoenzymes', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', '4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide (56-57-5)', 'GSTP1 protein, human (EC 2.5.1.18)', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi (EC 2.5.1.18)', 'Glutathione Transferase (EC 2.5.1.18)', 'Glutathione (GAN16C9B8O)', 'multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (Y49M64GZ4Q)']"

Owing to the depletion of vials of Lot 1 in March 2001, the present committee certified a new reference material, Lot 2, now distributed by the Health Care Technology Foundation (HECTEF). The standardization programme for HbA1c measurement in Japan is currently based on Lot 2, which has values assigned from within Lot 1; the Lot 1 values were consensus values based on assays by laboratories in the Japanese national quality control programme. In this study, for the purpose of international comparison and standardization, Lot 2 was assayed by the JDS reference laboratories, the National Glycoprotein Standardization Program (NGSP) in the USA, and by reference laboratories approved by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC).!##!Method!#!The HbA1c values of JDS Lot 2 were transferred from those assigned to Lot 1 using KO500, a high-resolution HPLC method, at three laboratories approved by the JDS committee. Subsequently, vials of JDS Lot 2 were shipped to and assayed by the NGSP in the USA and 10 IFCC reference laboratories.!##!Result!#!The JDS-assigned HbA1c values (from Lot 1) are 4.04 for Level 1, 5.38 for Level 2, 7.32 for Level 3, 9.88 for Level 4, and 12.63 for Level 5, all expressed as a percentage of total haemoglobin.

In addition, standardization of HbA1c based on JDS Lot 2 is currently at a satisfactory level in Japan. As a result, the reassignment of values for Lot 2 to agree with the IFCC values should be relatively easy and will be done after all relevant parties agree to the change.']",['eng'],"['Blood Chemical Analysis/methods', 'Blood Chemical Analysis/standards', 'Calibration', 'Diabetes Mellitus/diagnosis', 'Glycated Hemoglobin A/analysis', 'Glycated Hemoglobin A/standards', 'Humans', 'International Cooperation', 'Japan', 'Laboratories/standards', 'Quality Control', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'United States']",['Glycated Hemoglobin A']

M15886587,['The use of positive end-expiratory pressure in the management of the acute respiratory distress syndrome.'],"['Clinical and experimental research on the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) has produced a plethora of information during the last two decades. The application of PEEP is expected to increase PaO2; however, it is generally agreed that simply using increased PaO2 as the end point is inappropriate. Four mechanisms have been proposed to explain the improved pulmonary function and gas exchange with PEEP: 1) increased functional residual capacity; 2) alveolar recruitment; 3) redistribution of extravascular lung water; and 4) improved ventilation-perfusion matching. The optimal method of applying PEEP is still controversial. The main effect of augmenting PEEP is maintain recruitment of alveolar units that were previously collapsed. Thus, since tidal volume is distributed to more alveoli, peak airway pressure is reduced and compliance is increased. During acute lung injury, and depending on the severity of lung disease, PEEP can markedly alter the compliance of the lung by alveolar recruitment. The greater the alveolar collapse and pulmonary edema, the more the compliance curve of the respiratory system shifts downward and to the right. As PEEP is applied and alveoli recruited, the pressure-volume curve shifts upward and to the left. Despite its intuitive benefit, there were very few controlled studies of the effects of PEEP on ARDS outcome and no prospective randomised controlled trial of PEEP has been ever carried out in patients with acute lung injury and/ or ARDS to evaluate its efficacy until recently.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Lung/physiopathology', 'Positive-Pressure Respiration', 'Respiration, Artificial/adverse effects', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult/physiopathology', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult/therapy', 'Respiratory Function Tests', 'Treatment Outcome']",

One specific form of breathing therapy, known as the Buteyko breathing technique (BBT) has received considerable attention, but there is a paucity of rigorous research evidence to support its recommendation for asthma patients. There are only four published clinical trials and two conference abstracts evaluating BBT. Although all have reported improvements in one or more outcome measures, results have not been consistent. This article provides the background to the BBT, reviews the available evidence for its use and examines the physiological hypothesis claimed to underpin it. In common with other therapies, BBT is not a standardised treatment modality. The BBT 'package' is complex, as it also includes advice and education about medication use, nutrition and exercise, and general relaxation. This makes it difficult, and possibly inappropriate, to attempt to tease out a single mechanism. Buteyko's theory relating to carbon dioxide levels and airway calibre is an attractive one, and has some basis in evidence from experimental studies. However, it is not known whether altering breathing patterns can raise carbon dioxide levels significantly, and there is currently insufficient evidence to confirm that this is the mechanism behind any effect that BBT may exert. Further research is necessary to establish unequivocally whether BBT is effective, and if so, how it may work.""]",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Asthma/drug therapy', 'Asthma/therapy', 'Breathing Exercises', 'Humans', 'Quality of Life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Respiration']",

However, despite opposition from medical authorities or the police, many western parents are increasingly adopting night-time infant caregiving patterns that include some co-sleeping, especially by those mothers who choose to breast feed. This review will show that the relationships between infant sleep patterns, infant sleeping arrangements and development both in the short and long term, whether having positive or negative outcomes, is anything but simple and the traditional habit of labelling one sleeping arrangement as being superior to another without an awareness of family, social and ethnic context is not only wrong but possibly harmful. We will show that there are many good reasons to insist that the definitions of different types of co-sleeping and bedsharing be recognised and distinguished. We will examine the conceptual issues related to the biological functions of mother-infant co-sleeping, bedsharing and what relationship each has to SIDS. At very least, we hope that the studies and data described in this paper, which show that co-sleeping at least in the form of roomsharing especially with an actively breast feeding mother saves lives, is a powerful reason why the simplistic, scientifically inaccurate and misleading statement 'never sleep with your baby' needs to be rescinded, wherever and whenever it is published.""]",['eng'],"['Beds', 'Breast Feeding', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Care/methods', 'Infant Care/standards', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Mother-Child Relations', 'Risk Factors', 'Sleep/physiology', 'Sudden Infant Death/etiology', 'Sudden Infant Death/prevention & control']",

To investigate this, normal readers (n=19) and children with developmental dyslexia (n=16) were asked to perform various cognitive, literacy, and balancing tasks. Children balanced on the left or right foot, with eyes open or closed, for a period of 10 s during which their movements were recorded with a motion-tracking system. Dyslexic children were less stable than the control children in both eyes-open conditions (left foot P=0.02, right foot P=0.012). While there were no group differences during the eyes-closed conditions, the dyslexic children dropped a foot to correct balance significantly more often than control children (P<0.05). Incidence analysis showed that 50% of the dyslexic group fell into the 'impaired' category on the eyes-open balancing tasks; when the mean balancing scores and the foot drops were considered, only three of our dyslexic children showed no evidence of balancing difficulties. There were strong correlations between reading and spelling scores and the mean eyes-open balancing score (r=0.52 and 0.44, respectively).

The roles of reliability and standard error of measurement (SEM) in classic test theory are also briefly reviewed. This is followed by illustrations of how SEM and test reliability can aid with the interpretation of a simple discrepancy-based formula of DD. It is proposed that a lack of consideration of test theory in the use of discrepancy-based models of DD can lead to misdiagnosis (both false positives and false negatives).

Prone infant sleep position and maternal smoking have been established as risk factors for SIDS mortality. Some studies have found that bedsharing is associated with SIDS, but, to date, there is only strong evidence for a risk among infants of smoking mothers and some evidence of a risk among young infants of nonsmoking mothers. Despite the lack of convincing scientific evidence, bedsharing with nonsmoking mothers remains controversial. In some states, nonsmoking mothers are currently being told that they should not bedshare with their infants, and mothers of infants who died of SIDS are told that they caused the death of their infant because they bedshared. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between maternal smoking and bedsharing among Oregon mothers to explore whether smoking mothers, in contrast to nonsmoking mothers, are getting the message that they should not bedshare.!##!Methods!#!Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System surveys a stratified random sample, drawn from birth certificates, of women after a live birth. Hispanic and non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Native women, and non-Hispanic white women with low birth weight infants are oversampled to ensure sufficient numbers for stratified analysis. The sample then was weighted to reflect Oregon\'s population. In 1998-1999, 1867 women completed the survey (73.5% weighted response). The median time from birth to completion of the survey was 4 months. Women were asked whether they shared a bed with their infant ""always,"" ""almost always,"" ""sometimes,"" or ""never."" Frequent bedsharing was defined as ""always"" or ""almost always""; infrequent was defined as ""sometimes"" or ""never.""!##!Results!#!Of all new mothers, 35.2% reported bedsharing frequently (always: 20.5%; almost always: 14.7%) and 64.8% infrequently (sometimes: 41.4%; never: 23.4%). Bedsharing among postpartum smoking mothers was 18.8% always, 12.6% almost always, 45.1% sometimes, and 23.6% never; this was not statistically different from among nonsmoking mothers. Results for prenatal smokers were similar. When stratified by race/ethnicity, there was no association between smoking and bedsharing in any racial or ethnic group. In univariable and multivariable logistic regression, there were no statistical differences in frequent or any bedsharing among either prenatal or postpartum smoking mothers compared with nonsmokers; the adjusted odds ratio for postpartum smokers who frequently bedshared was 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42-1.25) and for any bedsharing was 1.05 (95% CI: 0.57-1.94). Results for prenatal smoking were similar. This is the first US population-based study to look at the prevalence of bedsharing among smoking and nonsmoking mothers. Bedsharing is common in Oregon, with 35.2% of mothers in Oregon reporting frequently bedsharing and an additional 41.4% sometimes bedsharing. There was no significant association between smoking and bedsharing for either prenatal or postpartum smokers among any racial or ethnic group. Smoking mothers were as likely to bedshare as nonsmoking mothers. The frequency of bedsharing in Oregon was similar to estimates from other sources. Our study has the advantage of being a population-based sample drawn from birth certificates, weighted for nonresponse.!##!Conclusions!#!Although a number of case series have raised concerns about the safety of mother-infant bedsharing, even among nonsmoking mothers, this has not yet been confirmed by careful, controlled studies. There have been 9 large-scale case-control studies of the relationship between bedsharing and SIDS. Three case-control studies did not stratify by maternal smoking status, but found no increased risk for SIDS. Six case control studies reported results stratified by maternal smoking status: 1 study, while asserting an association, provided an unexplained range of univariable odds ratios without CIs; 3 found no increased risk for older infants of nonsmoking mothers; and 2 found a risk only for infants <8-11 weeks of age. Despite the preponderance of evidence that bedsharing by nonsmoking mothers does not increase the risk for SIDS among older infants, the recent specter of bedsharing as a cause of SIDS, based on uncontrolled case series and medical examiners\' anecdotal experience, has led some medical examiners to label a death ""suffocation"" or ""overlay asphyxiation"" simply because the infant was bedsharing at the time of death. This ""diagnostic drift"" may greatly complicate future studies of the relationship between bedsharing and SIDS. Epidemiologic evidence shows that there is little or no increased risk for SIDS among infants of nonsmoking mothers but increased risk among infants of smoking mothers and younger infants of nonsmoking mothers. It seems prudent to discourage bedsharing among all infants <3 months old. Young infants brought to bed to be breastfed should be returned to a crib when finished. It would be worthwhile for other researchers to reanalyze their previous data to evaluate the consistency of the interaction of young infant age and bedsharing. Large controlled studies that include infants who are identified as dying from SIDS, asphyxia, suffocation, and sudden unexplained infant death, analyzed separately and in combination, are needed to resolve this and other issues involving bedsharing, including the problem of diagnostic drift. Recommendations must be based on solid scientific evidence, which, to date, does not support the rejection of all bedsharing between nonsmoking mothers and their infants. Cribs should be available for those who want to use them. Nonsmoking mothers should not be pressured to abstain from bedsharing with their older infants; they should be provided with accurate, up-to-date scientific information. Infants also should not co-sleep with nonparents. In Oregon, if not elsewhere, the message that smoking mothers should not bedshare is not being disseminated effectively. Because it is not known whether the risk caused by smoking is associated with prenatal smoking, postpartum smoking, or both, bedsharing among either prenatal or postpartum smokers should be strongly discouraged. Much more public and private effort must be made to inform smoking mothers, in culturally competent ways, of the very significant risks of mixing bedsharing and smoking. Public health practitioners need to find new ways to inform mothers and providers that smoking mothers should not bedshare and that putting an infant of a nonsmoking mother to sleep in an adult bed should be delayed until 3 months of age.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Beds', 'Data Collection', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Care', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Prone Position', 'Risk Factors', 'Sleep', 'Smoking', 'Sudden Infant Death/etiology', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/adverse effects']",['Tobacco Smoke Pollution']

It is a 7beta-hydroxy epimer of the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). UDCA is isolated from the Chinese drug 'Yutan' a powder preparation derived from the dried bile of adult bears. For centuries, Yutan has been used in the treatment of hepatobiliary disorders. In Japan, it has also been in widespread use as a folk medicine from the mid-Edo period. In Japan, not only basic studies such as isolation, crystallization, definition of the chemical structure and establishment of the synthesis of UDCA have been conducted but clinical studies have been conducted. First reports on the effects of UDCA in patients with liver diseases came from Japan as early as 1961. In the 1970s, the first prospective study of patients with gallbladder stones treated with UDCA demonstrating gallstone dissolution was reported. In late 1980s, a number of controlled trials on the use of UDCA in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) were reported. Since then, a variety of clinical studies have shown the beneficial effect of UDCA in liver disease worldwide. To date, UDCA is utilized for the treatment of PBC for which it is the only drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In recent years, with the advent of molecular tools, the mechanisms of action of bile acids and UDCA have been investigated, and various bioactivities and pharmacological effects have been revealed.

Major advances in neonatology now enable even infants with a very low gestational age to survive. These infants have to spend months in the intensive care unit, while they have to deal with a lot of painful medical procedures, nursing care units, excessive noise and light, all differing from the normal uterine environment. The immature preterm infant nervous system is in a vulnerable phase of development. Early exposure to stress, or the mismatch of the preterm infant brain with the unphysiologic intensive care environment, may be linked to long-term developmental impairments reported in these children. The Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP) is a systematic method of assessing the individual needs of preterm newborns. In an attempt to mimic uterine environment, care according to the NIDCAP principles is reducing infant distress and in the same way supporting the individual aibilities. Thus NIDCAP may have an effect on the preterm infant neurodevelopmental outcome.']",['ger'],"['Child Development', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Infant Care', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Premature', 'Infant, Premature, Diseases/nursing', 'Infant, Premature, Diseases/prevention & control', 'Intensive Care Units, Neonatal']",

But knowledge about the nature of this association, its main risk factors and how to improve health outcomes in lower social groups is still limited. Social class has been defined by different indicators by e.g. occupation and job position or the highest school qualification achieved. For international comparisons different classifications such as ""The Registrar General\'s Social Class Classification "" or the ""International Standard Classification of Education"" have been used. Several European Studies show a higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular risk factors including smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia in lower socioeconomic classes. But this studies also show that all socioeconomic groups have access to medical services. The Data from the Swiss Health Survey show the distribution of cardiovascular risk factors and diseases by three levels of education: Behaviouralfactors such as smoking, obesity and physical inactivity are more commonly present in the lower socioeconomic groups. People with a lower educational level visit their GP more often, whereas people with a higher level of educational consult specialists more frequently. Medical services are often used to check of blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol. An indication of state of health may be shown by medication and treatment for cardiovascular disease which is more prevalent in lower socioeconomic groups. The present discussion of explanations of the poorer state of health in lower socioeconomic groups goes beyond the classical risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Studies have shown that after the correction for risk factors a correlation remains between social class and state of health. It is believed, that psychosocial factors such as self-esteem, control in the workplace or coping-strategies play an additional important role in staying healthy. Therefore prevention of cardiovascular disease should not be restricted to minimisation of risk factors or to the measurement of certain blood-values and treatments. Efforts must also go into creating the conditions for a healthier life and promote possibilities for healthier behaviour in all socioeconomic classes.']",['ger'],"['Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/prevention & control', 'Educational Status', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Health Behavior', 'Health Promotion/methods', 'Humans', 'Patient Education as Topic/methods', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction Behavior', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",

Low-grade infections are often manifest as early loosening with or without pain. They are therefore difficult to distinguish from aseptic failure. For an accurate diagnosis of prosthetic joint infections, a combination of preoperative and intraoperative tests is usually needed.

It is a most common orthopaedic complaint in the Kaski region of Nepal. The reason for its increased incidence may be hilly terrain, difficult working and living environment of the region. The initial treatment of Low back pain is conservative. Epidural steroid injection is being slowly established as are liable mode of conservative management in many orthopaedic centres of the world. This is a preliminary report of on-going study of the use of epidural steroid in the management of low back pain cases coming to the orthopaedic department of Manipal Teaching Hospital.!##!Methods!#!Prospective clinical trial was carried out on the patients reporting with low back pain and sciatica not responding to other modes of conservative treatment. Pre and post injection evaluation was done clinically. The level of pain, improvement in physical signs and ability to do activities of daily living were noted.!##!Results!#!Fifty two patients were observed for the average duration of 2.87 months. Average duration of symptoms was for 10 months. After first epidural steroid injection 83% of patients reported relief on day one. In some cases the onset of analgesia was delayed. Four patients reported no relief after first injection. Fifteen patients were given two injections and four received three injections. The average duration between two injections was three weeks. Average duration of pain relief was 20 days. At the end of 3 months, good results were seen in 39%, fair in 33% and bad results in 27%. Overall 59% of patients were able to do activities of daily living. Three patients (5.76%)required operation for disc prolapse. Postoperatively two patients reported back with back pain. Most common complaint of patients after injection was pain at the injection site.

The goal of the comparison was to find a parsimonious approach for determining resident placement in LTC using the MDS and MMSE. Using a descriptive comparative design, the study took place at a not-for-profit, urban, continuing care retirement center (CCRC) with a 120-bed skilled nursing facility and a 34-unit assisted living facility. Sixty residents, 15 from each of the 3 skilled nursing units and assisted living unit, consented to participate. To understand the differences in the MDS and MMSE scores between units, a Level of Care Algorithm was constructed to analyze resident placement. Results revealed that MDS and MMSE scores placed greater than 75% of elders who had extremely poor cognitive or physical function but did not discriminate well for residents with moderate cognitive and/or physical impairment. For these residents, interaction between institutional philosophy (aging in place versus moving to a new location); resource availability; and elder, family, and staff values and preferences may have influenced placement.']",['eng'],"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care/organization & administration', 'Assisted Living Facilities/organization & administration', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognition Disorders/diagnosis', 'Female', 'Geriatric Assessment/methods', 'Health Status', 'Housing for the Elderly/organization & administration', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Status Schedule', 'Needs Assessment', 'Organizational Policy', 'Patient Selection', 'Philosophy, Medical', 'Progressive Patient Care/organization & administration', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities/organization & administration']",

MEX is comprises four putative zinc-binding domains including an N-terminal SWIM (SWI2/SNF2 and MuDR) domain of unknown function and two RING (really interesting new gene) fingers separated by a ZZ zinc finger domain. Biochemical analyses revealed that MEX is self-ubiquitinated and targeted for degradation through the proteasome pathway. MEX can act as an E3, Ub (ubiquitin) ligase, through the E2, Ub-conjugating enzymes UbcH5a, UbcH5c or UbcH6. A region of MEX that contains the RING fingers and the ZZ zinc finger was required for interaction with UbcH5a and MEX self-association, whereas the SWIM domain was critical for MEX ubiquitination. The expression of MEX promoted apoptosis that was induced through Fas, DR (death receptor) 3 and DR4 signalling, but not that mediated by the BH3 (Bcl-2 homology 3)-only protein BimEL or the chemotherapeutic drug adriamycin. The enhancement of apoptosis by MEX required a functional SWIM domain, suggesting that MEX ubiquitination is critical for the enhancement of apoptosis. These results indicate that MEX acts as an E3 Ub ligase, an activity that is dependent on the SWIM domain and suggest a role for MEX in the regulation of death receptor-induced apoptosis in the testes.']",['eng'],"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Iron-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Rats', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 25', 'Testis/enzymology', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/chemistry', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/physiology', 'Zinc Fingers/physiology', 'fas Receptor/physiology']","['Iron-Binding Proteins', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 25', 'TNFRSF10A protein, human', 'TNFRSF25 protein, human', 'Tnfrsf25 protein, mouse', 'fas Receptor', 'UBE2D1 protein, human (EC 2.3.2.23)', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes (EC 2.3.2.23)', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases (EC 2.3.2.27)', 'Zswim2 protein, mouse (EC 2.3.2.27)', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex (EC 3.4.25.1)']"

This study provides a national perspective on medication delivery in AL settings from the perspectives of state Board of Nursing (BON) executives. Qualitative interviews using semi-structured interview guides were conducted with BON executives to validate a legal summary of AL regulations and nurse practice acts, and to identify nursing issues pertaining to medication management in AL across the United States. In this study, there was considerable variation across states regarding medication administration and the role of both the RN and the UAP. BON executives displayed a range of knowledge about nursing practice issues in AL, with many reporting low familiarity with this setting. Mechanisms for systematic review of quality of delegation were not in place. Medication administration and nurse delegation were dynamic issues, with practice and policy evolving concurrently. This study highlights the limited articulation of policies between agencies and across states in the important and growing setting of assisted living.

The species dependence observed is consistent with phylogenetic relationships previously derived from plant morphological characteristics and from nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons of the two Rubisco subunits. Species dependence in the Rubisco-Rubisco activase interaction and the absence of major anomalies in the deduced amino acid sequence of tobacco Rubisco activase compared to sequences in non-Solanaceae species suggest that Rubisco and Rubisco activase may have coevolved such that amino acid changes that have arisen by evolutionary divergence in one of these enzymes through spontaneous mutation or selection pressure have led to compensatory changes in the other enzyme.']",['eng'],,

Catalysis of rubisco activation by spinach and cloned rubisco activase was accompanied by the same extent of carboxyarabinitol bisphosphate-trapped (14)CO(2) as occurred in spontaneous activation, indicating that rubisco carbamylation is one facet of the rubisco activase reaction.

Based on these figures, the protein comprised approximately 2% by weight of soluble protein in spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) leaves. The preparations were at least 95% pure and were stable when frozen in liquid nitrogen. Addition of ATP during purification and storage was necessary to maintain activity. Assay of rubisco activase was based on its ability to promote activation of rubisco in the presence of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. There was an absolute requirement for ATP which could not be replaced by other nucleoside phosphates. The initial rate of increase of rubisco activity and the final rubisco specific activity achieved were both dependent on the concentration of rubisco activase. The initial rate was directly proportional to the rubisco activase concentration and was used as the basis of activity. The rate of activation of rubisco was also dependent on the rubisco concentration, suggesting that the activation process is a second order reaction dependent on the concentrations of both rubisco and rubisco activase. It is suggested that deactivation of rubisco occurs simultaneously with rubisco activase-mediated activation, and that rubisco activation state represents a dynamic equilibrium between these two processes.']",['eng'],,

During an 11-minute time course at pH 7.7 and 11 micromolar CO(2), the activation of rubisco was strongly inhibited by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (4 millimolar), fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (1 millimolar) and ribose 5-phosphate (5 millimolar), but this inhibition was overcome by the addition of rubisco activase and activation then proceeded to a greater extent than spontaneous activation of rubisco. Glycerate 3-phosphate (20 millomolar) slowed the initial rate but not the extent of activation and rubisco activase had no effect on this. The activation of rubisco was shown to be affected by phosphoenolpyruvate (3 millimolar) but not by creatine phosphate (3 millimolar) or ATP (3 millimolar), and the creatine-phosphate/creatine phosphokinase system was used to generate the high ATP/ADP quotients required for rubisco activase to function. ATP was shown to be required for the rubisco activase-dependent rubisco activation in the presence of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (1 millimolar). It is concluded that rubisco activase has a mixed specificity for some sugar phosphate-bound forms of rubisco, but has low or no activity with others.

Electron transport inhibitors and artificial electron donors and acceptors were used to determine in which region of the photosynthetic electron transport chain this light-dependent reaction occurred. In the presence of DCMU and methyl viologen, the artificial donors durohydroquinone and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) plus ascorbate both supported light activation of rubisco at saturating ATP concentrations. No light activation occurred when DCPIP was used as an acceptor with water as electron donor in the presence of ATP and dibromothymoquinone, even though photosynthetic electron transport was observed. Nigericin completely inhibited the light-dependent activation of rubisco. Based on these results, we conclude that stimulation of light activation of rubisco by rubisco activase requires electron transport through PSI but not PSII, and that this light requirement is not to supply the ATP needed by the rubisco activase reaction. Furthermore, a pH gradient across the thylakoid membrane appears necessary for maximum light activation of rubisco even when ATP is provided exogenously.']",['eng'],,

The effect of Rubisco activase on the dissociation kinetics of RuBP bound to this form of the enzyme was examined and characterized with the use of (3)H-labeled RuBP and proteins purified from spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) In the absence of Rubisco activase and in the presence of a large excess of unlabeled RuBP, the dissociation rate of bound [1-(3)H]RuBP was much faster after a short (30 second) incubation than after an extended incubation (1 hour). After 1 hour of incubation, the dissociation rate constant (K(off)) of the bound RuBP was 4.8 x 10(-4) per second, equal to a half-time of about 35 minutes, whereas the rate after only 30 seconds was too fast to be accurately measured. This time-dependent change in the dissociation rate was reflected in the subsequent activation kinetics of Rubisco in the presence of RuBP, CO(2), and Mg(2+), and in both the absence or presence of Rubisco activase. However, the activation of Rubisco also proceeded relatively rapidly without Rubisco activase if the RuBP level decreased below the estimated catalytic site concentration. High pH (pH 8.5) and the presence of Mg(2+) in the medium also enhanced the dissociation of the bound RuBP from Rubisco in the presence of RuBP. In the presence of Rubisco activase, Mg(2+), ATP (but not the nonhydrolyzable analog, adenosine-5'-O-[3-thiotriphosphate]), excess RuBP, and an ATP-regenerating system, the dissociation of [1-(3)H]RuBP from Rubisco was increased in proportion to the amount of Rubisco activase added. This result indicates that Rubisco activase-mediated hydrolysis of ATP is required for promotion of the enhanced dissociation of the bound RuBP from Rubisco. Furthermore, product analysis by ion-exchange chromatography demonstrated that the release of the bound RuBP, in an unchanged form, was considerably faster than the observed increase in Rubisco activity. Thus, RuBP dissociation was experimentally separated from activation and precedes the subsequent formation of active, carbamylated Rubisco during activation of Rubisco by Rubisco activase.""]",['eng'],,

Motivating factors for complementary therapy use included concerns about conventional NHS care (""push factors"") and attractive aspects of complementary therapies (""pull factors""). While participants were often uncertain whether therapies had directly helped their asthma, breathing techniques such as the Buteyko Method were most notably reported to enhance symptom control and enable reduction in medication.

In this study, this behavior is investigated based on the kinetics of ionic diffusion. As a model ionic liquid, we chose butyldimethylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BDMIPF(6)). The common solvent was propylene carbonate (PC), and lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF(6)) was selected as the lithium conducting salt. Ionic diffusion coefficients are estimated by using a pulsed field gradient NMR technique. From a basic study on the model electrolytes (BDMIPF(6) in PC, LiPF(6) in PC, and BDMIPF(6) + LiPF(6) in PC), it was found that the BDMI(+) from BDMIPF(6) shows larger diffusion coefficients than the Li(+) from LiPF(6). However, the anionic (PF(6)(-)) diffusion coefficients present little difference between the model electrolytes. The higher diffusion coefficient of BDMI(+) than that of Li(+) suggests that the poor C-rate performance of lithium ion cells containing ionic liquids as an electrolyte component can be attributed to the two-cation competition between Li(+) and BDMI(+).']",['eng'],,

However, few studies compare IS(Ci) with ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) properties. Here, we assessed Rubisco activation state and in vitro Rubisco kinetics, the main determinants of IS(Ci), in spinach leaves grown at 30/25 [high temperature (HT)] and 15/10 degrees C [low temperature (LT)]. We measured Rubisco activation state and A at a CO2 concentration of 360 microL L(-1) (A360) at various temperatures. In both HT and LT leaves, the Rubisco activation state decreased with increasing temperatures above the optimum temperatures for A360, while the activation state remained high at lower temperatures. To compare Rubisco characteristics, temperature dependences of the maximum rate of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylation (Vcmax), specificity factor (Sc/o) and thermal stability were examined. We also examined Vcmax, and thermal stability in the leaves that were transferred from HT to LT conditions and were subsequently kept under LT conditions for 2 weeks (HL). Rubisco purified from HT, LT and HL leaves are called HT, LT and HL Rubisco, respectively. Thermal stabilities of LT and HL Rubisco were similar and lower than that of HT Rubisco. Both Vcmax and Sc/o in LT Rubisco were higher than those of HT Rubisco at low temperatures, while these were lower at high temperatures. Vcmax in HL Rubisco were similar to those of LT Rubisco at low temperatures, and to those of HT Rubisco at high temperatures. The predicted photosynthetic rates, taking account of the Rubisco kinetics and the Rubisco activation state, agreed well with A360 in both HT and LT leaves. This study suggests that photosynthetic performance is largely determined by the Rubisco kinetics at low temperature and by Rubisco Kinetics and the Rubisco activation state at high temperature.']",['eng'],"['Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Photosynthesis/physiology', 'Plant Leaves/enzymology', 'Plant Leaves/growth & development', 'Plant Leaves/physiology', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase/metabolism', 'Ribulosephosphates/metabolism', 'Spinacia oleracea/enzymology', 'Spinacia oleracea/growth & development', 'Spinacia oleracea/physiology', 'Temperature']","['Ribulosephosphates', 'ribulose-1,5 diphosphate (2002-28-0)', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.39)']"

It could not only improve the light absorbance and the transformation from light energy to electron energy and to active chemical energy but also promote carbon dioxide (CO2) assimilation of spinach. However, the mechanism of carbon reaction promoted by nano-anatase TiO2 remains largely unclear. By electrophoresis and Western blot methods, the results of the experiments proved that Rubisco from the nano-anatase TiO2-treated spinach during the extraction procedure of Rubisco was found to consist of Rubisco and a heavier molecular-mass protein (about 1,200 kDa) comprising both Rubisco and Rubisco activase. The Rubisco carboxylase activity was 2.67 times that of Rubisco from the control and it could hydrolyze ATP in the same manner as Rubisco activase. The total sulfhydryl groups and available sulfhydryl groups of the Rubisco were 32 -SH and 21 -SH per mole of enzyme more than those of the Rubisco purified from the control, respectively. The circular dichroism spectra showed that the secondary structure of Rubisco from the nano-anatase TiO2-treated spinach was very different from Rubisco of the control. It suggested that the mechanism of nano-anatase TiO2 activating Rubisco of spinach was that the complex of Rubsico and Rubisco activase was induced in spinach, which promoted Rubsico carboxylation and increased the rate of photosynthetic carbon reaction.']",['eng'],"['Carbon Dioxide/metabolism', 'Catalysis', 'Nanostructures/chemistry', 'Photosensitizing Agents/pharmacology', 'Photosynthesis/drug effects', 'Plant Proteins/chemistry', 'Plant Proteins/metabolism', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase/metabolism', 'Spinacia oleracea/drug effects', 'Spinacia oleracea/enzymology', 'Titanium/chemistry', 'Titanium/pharmacology']","['Photosensitizing Agents', 'Plant Proteins', 'rca protein, plant', 'Carbon Dioxide (142M471B3J)', 'titanium dioxide (15FIX9V2JP)', 'Titanium (D1JT611TNE)', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.39)']"

However, validation of inferences from multiscale inventories such as the MMPI-2 is limited at present by a disconnection between the integrative manner in which MMPI-2 profiles are interpreted and the scale-by-scale nature of most MMPI-2 validation studies.

Persons with dyslexia often have deficits in processing rapid temporal sensory information. There is also evidence of sensorimotor deficits in persons with dyslexia. Whether these deficits include ocular motor problems is still an open question. Some previous studies have shown an increased saccadic latency in dyslexics, whereas others have not reproduced this finding. The purpose of the present study was to investigate saccadic latency in young adults with dyslexia during the double-step paradigm, a task that requires rapid sequential visual information processing and saccade generation. The study hypothesis was that dyslexics have a longer saccadic latency in the second orthogonal saccade, a task that nondyslexics parallel process and perform rapidly.!##!Methods!#!Eight students with dyslexia and eight age-matched control subjects participated in the study. Their eye movements were monitored with the scleral search coil technique in simple saccade trials and in the double-step paradigm. The second saccade was either orthogonal or colinear to the first. Intersaccadic interval and latency were calculated for the second saccade.!##!Results!#!No difference in saccadic latency was found for colinear second saccades; however, dyslexics had significantly longer latencies for orthogonal second saccades. This included a subset of subjects who had longer latencies for orthogonal than for colinear saccades.!##!Conclusions!#!The findings indicate that under certain conditions, when the demand for rapid visual information processing is high and a rapid saccade sequence is required, some persons with dyslexia show ocular motor deficits manifested by longer saccadic latencies.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological', 'Dyslexia/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Ocular Motility Disorders/physiopathology', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Reaction Time', 'Saccades/physiology']",

That is why preventative measures are strongly worth to do it, and removal of the prosthesis is the single optimal treatment. Each step in the pathogenesis of prosthetic joint infection may represent relevant targets against which prevention strategies may be directed.

It catalyzes ubiquinone (UQ) reduction by ETF, linking oxidation of fatty acids and some amino acids to the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Deficiencies in ETF or ETF-QO result in multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, a human metabolic disease. Crystal structures of ETF-QO with and without bound UQ were determined, and they are essentially identical. The molecule forms a single structural domain. Three functional regions bind FAD, the 4Fe4S cluster, and UQ and are closely packed and share structural elements, resulting in no discrete structural domains. The UQ-binding pocket consists mainly of hydrophobic residues, and UQ binding differs from that of other UQ-binding proteins. ETF-QO is a monotopic integral membrane protein. The putative membrane-binding surface contains an alpha-helix and a beta-hairpin, forming a hydrophobic plateau. The UQ-flavin distance (8.5 A) is shorter than the UQ-cluster distance (18.8 A), and the very similar redox potentials of FAD and the cluster strongly suggest that the flavin, not the cluster, transfers electrons to UQ. Two possible electron transfer paths can be envisioned. First, electrons from the ETF flavin semiquinone may enter the ETF-QO flavin one by one, followed by rapid equilibration with the cluster. Alternatively, electrons may enter via the cluster, followed by equilibration between centers. In both cases, when ETF-QO is reduced to a two-electron reduced state (one electron at each redox center), the enzyme is primed to reduce UQ to ubiquinol via FAD.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Electron Transport', 'Electron-Transferring Flavoproteins/chemistry', 'Electron-Transferring Flavoproteins/metabolism', 'Iron/chemistry', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins/chemistry', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondria, Liver/enzymology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/chemistry', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Static Electricity', 'Sulfur/chemistry', 'Sulfur/metabolism', 'Swine', 'Ubiquinone/chemistry', 'Ubiquinone/metabolism']","['Electron-Transferring Flavoproteins', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins', 'Ubiquinone (1339-63-5)', 'Sulfur (70FD1KFU70)', 'Iron (E1UOL152H7)', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors (EC 1.5.-)', 'electron-transferring-flavoprotein dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.5.1)']"

The polycomb repressive complex 2 complex possesses histone methyltransferase activity mediated by the Su(var)3-9, enhancer of zeste, and trithorax domain of EZH2, which methylates histone H3 on lysine (K)-27 (H3K27). In the present studies, we determined that treatment with the hydroxamate histone deacetylase inhibitor LBH589 or LAQ824 depleted the protein levels of EZH2, SUZ12, and EED in the cultured (K562, U937, and HL-60) and primary human acute leukemia cells. This was associated with decreased levels of trimethylated and dimethylated H3K27, with concomitant depletion of the homeobox domain containing HOXA9 and of MEIS1 transcription factors. Knockdown of EZH2 by EZH2 small interfering RNA also depleted SUZ12 and EED, inhibited histone methyltransferase activity, and reduced trimethylated and dimethylated H3K27 levels, with a concomitant loss of clonogenic survival of the cultured acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells. EZH2 small interfering RNA sensitized the AML cells to LBH589-mediated depletion of EZH2, SUZ12, and EED; loss of clonogenic survival; and LBH589-induced differentiation of the AML cells. These findings support the rationale to test anti-EZH2 treatment combined with hydroxamate histone deacetylase inhibitors as an antileukemia epigenetic therapy, especially against AML with coexpression of EZH2, HOXA9, and MEIS1 genes.']",['eng'],"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Acute Disease', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Chronic Disease', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/chemistry', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Indoles', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Panobinostat', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'Protein Methyltransferases', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']","['Carrier Proteins', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'EED protein, human', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histones', 'Hydroxamic Acids', 'Indoles', 'LAQ824', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Repressor Proteins', 'SUZ12 protein, human', 'Transcription Factors', 'Panobinostat (9647FM7Y3Z)', 'Histone Methyltransferases (EC 2.1.1.-)', 'Protein Methyltransferases (EC 2.1.1.-)', 'EZH2 protein, human (EC 2.1.1.43)', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein (EC 2.1.1.43)', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.43)', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (EC 2.1.1.43)', 'Histone Deacetylases (EC 3.5.1.98)']"

They promote mechanisms important for normal resolution of inflammation, notably macrophage phagocytosis of leukocytes undergoing apoptosis. Prereceptor metabolism of glucocorticoids by 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) amplifies intracellular levels of glucocorticoids by oxoreduction of intrinsically inert cortisone (in humans, 11-dehydrocorticosterone in mice) into active cortisol (corticosterone in mice) within cells expressing the enzyme. Recently, we have shown in a mouse model of acute inflammation, high expression of 11beta-HSD oxoreductase but not dehydrogenase activity in cells elicited rapidly in the peritoneum by a single thioglycollate injection. 11beta-HSD oxoreductase activity remained high in peritoneal cells until the inflammation resolved. In vitro, the 11beta-HSD1 substrate, 11-dehydrocorticosterone, increased macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils to the same extent as corticosterone. This effect was dependent upon 11beta-HSD1: these cells solely expressed the type 1 11beta-HSD isozyme (not 11beta-HSD2), and carbenoxolone, an 11beta-HSD inhibitor, prevented the increase in phagocytosis elicited by 11-dehydrocorticosterone. Macrophages from 11beta-HSD1-deficient mice failed to respond to 11-dehydrocorticosterone. In vivo, 11beta-HSD1-deficient mice showed a delay in acquisition of macrophage phagocytic competence and had an increased number of free apoptotic neutrophils during sterile peritonitis. Importantly, in preliminary experiments, 11beta-HSD1-deficient mice exhibited delayed resolution of inflammation in experimental arthritis. These findings suggest 11beta-HSD1 may be a component of mechanisms engaged early during the inflammatory response that promote its subsequent resolution.']",['eng'],"['11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1/immunology', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1/metabolism', 'Acute-Phase Reaction/immunology', 'Animals', 'Glucocorticoids/immunology', 'Glucocorticoids/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/immunology', 'Inflammation/metabolism', 'Macrophages/immunology']","['Glucocorticoids', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 (EC 1.1.1.146)']"

Our aims are to: (1) Compare pulmonary hemorrhage in SIDS and a control group comprised of infants whose deaths were attributed to accidental or inflicted suffocation. (2) Review individual cases with the most severe pulmonary hemorrhage regardless of the cause of death, and (3) Assess the effect of age, bedsharing, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and postmortem interval, with regard to the severity of pulmonary hemorrhage in SIDS cases. We conducted a retrospective study of all postneonatal cases accessioned by the Office of the Medical Examiner in San Diego County, California who died of SIDS or suffocation between 1999 and 2004. A total of 444 cases of sudden infant death caused by SIDS (405), accidental suffocation (36), and inflicted suffocation (3) from the San Diego SIDS/SUDC Research Project database were compared using a semiquantitative measure of pulmonary intra-alveolar hemorrhage [absent (0) to severe (4)]. Grades 3 or 4 pulmonary hemorrhage occurred in 33% of deaths attributed to suffocation, but in only 11% of the SIDS cases, however, all grades of pulmonary hemorrhage occurred in both groups. Therefore, our results indicate that the severity of pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be used in isolation to determine the cause or manner of sudden infant death. Among SIDS cases, those with a higher pulmonary hemorrhage grade (3 or 4) were more likely to bedshare, and with more than one co-sleeper, than those with a lower pulmonary hemorrhage grade (0 or 1).

The antiserum against 11-dehydrocorticosterone 21-hemisuccinate-conjugated bovine serum albumin was raised in rabbits. As an enzyme-labeled antigen, 11-dehydrocorticosterone 21-hemisuccinate was conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Two ELISA systems were established: one without the extraction of steroids from serum (direct method), and another that used an HPLC purification step (HPLC method). The cross-reactivity of all steroids tested against the antibody was low except cortisone (92%); however, since cortisone levels in rats and mice are negligible, cortisone does not interfere with this direct ELISA. The measurable range of serum 11-dehydrocortiocosterone in both the direct and HPLC methods was 0.3-250 ng/ml and 0.78-400 ng/ml, respectively. Both methods displayed satisfactory parallel dilution, recovery and reproducibility; moreover, the values obtained with each method significantly correlated with the alternate method. To evaluate the two ELISA systems, the serum concentrations of 11-dehydrocorticosterone in normal rats and mice were determined by these two systems. The levels in Wistar rats fluctuated from 3 to 14 weeks of age (7.8+/-2.6 ng/ml) but at 1 week (1.7+/-1.2 ng/ml) were significantly low compared to other ages. No sex differences were found in rats and mice. Further, using the proposed direct method, chronological changes of rat serum 11-dehydrocorticosterone levels after 11-dehydrocorticosterone administration have been investigated together with corticosterone levels. These results verify that the proposed ELISA for 11-dehydrocorticosterone is useful for measuring 11beta-HSD activities in combination with the determination of serum corticosterone in rats and mice.']",['eng'],"['11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/metabolism', 'Administration, Oral', 'Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antibody Specificity/immunology', 'Calibration', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Corticosterone/administration & dosage', 'Corticosterone/analogs & derivatives', 'Corticosterone/blood', 'Corticosterone/immunology', 'Corticosterone/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Female', 'Horseradish Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Immune Sera/immunology', 'Indicator Dilution Techniques', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Pregnancy', 'Protein Binding', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/metabolism', 'Time Factors']","['Immune Sera', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine (27432CM55Q)', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.146)', 'Horseradish Peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.-)', '11-dehydrocorticosterone (FO4V44A3G3)', 'Corticosterone (W980KJ009P)']"

Recently, we isolated JTB as a TGF-beta1-inducible clone by differential screening. In this study, we characterized its product and biological functions. We found that it was processed at the N-terminus and located mostly in mitochondria. When expressed in cells, JTB-induced clustering of mitochondria around the nuclear periphery and swelling of each mitochondrion. In those mitochondria, membrane potential, as monitored with a JC-1 probe, was significantly reduced. Coinciding with these changes in mitochondria, JTB retarded the growth of the cells and conferred resistance to TGF-beta1-induced apoptosis. These activities were dependent on the N-terminal processing and induced by wild-type JTB but not by a mutant resistant to cleavage. These findings raised the possibility that aberration of JTB in structure or expression induced neoplastic changes in cells through dysfunction of mitochondria leading to deregulated cell growth and/or death.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Death/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Epithelial Cells/physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interspersed Repetitive Sequences', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/cytology', 'Membrane Potentials/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/genetics', 'Mitochondria/physiology', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reference Values', 'Translocation, Genetic']","['RNA, Messenger']"

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia that is observed in clinical practice and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, resulting from stroke and exacerbation of heart failure. At present, there is a lack of pharmacologic agents that are able to safely and effectively convert the arrhythmia back to sinus rhythm. Vernakalant has the electrophysiologic properties of a multiple ion channel blocker, developed using a novel approach to target potassium channels that are selectively present in human atria rather than ventricles, and using a rate-dependent blocking strategy for its additional sodium channel block. This paper reviews the mechanism of action of this drug, its performance in preclinical models of efficacy and human disease, and its actions on patients in the completed and published preregistration clinical trials for vernakalant. Overall, vernakalant converted 51.5% of patients who had < 7 days duration of atrial fibrillation and it did this without significantly more cardiovascular adverse events than placebo.

However, the significance of glucocorticoid metabolism in specific kidney regions in vivo is not clear, possibly in part due to the difficulty in measuring glucocorticoid levels in kidney regions in vivo. We used microdialysis techniques to sample renal interstitial fluid from conscious rats. The levels of corticosterone (active) and 11-dehydrocorticosterone (inactive) were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Direct infusion of the 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11beta-HSD) inhibitor carbenoxolone into the renal medulla induced hypertension, and significantly increased corticosterone levels and the corticosterone/11-dehydrocorticosterone ratio, an index of 11beta-HSD activity, in the renal medullary microdialysate, but not in urine or the plasma. Further characterization of conscious, untreated rats (n = 13-16) indicated that corticosterone concentrations (ng/ml) were 0.8 +/- 0.1, 1.0 +/- 0.1, 66.7 +/- 8.1, and 7.9 +/- 1.1 in cortical microdialysate, medullary microdialysate, the plasma, and urine, respectively.

The expression level of 11beta-HSD1 was higher in the medulla than in the cortex, whereas 11beta-HSD2 was most enriched in the outer medulla. Microdialysate levels of corticosterone were approximately 1.6-fold higher in afternoons than in mornings, whereas plasma levels differed by 2.8-fold.

We took representative random samples from deaths reported to registries in Flanders, Belgium in 1998 (n=3999) at the beginning of the process and in 2001 (N=5005), at the end of the process. The reporting physicians received an anonymous mail questionnaire about possible ELDs preceding the death involved. We found no significant shifts in the epidemiology of diseases between 1998 and 2001. The overall incidence of ELDs did not change. The incidence decreased for euthanasia, administering life-ending drugs without patient's explicit request, and alleviation of pain and symptoms with life-shortening co-intention. Incidence increased for alleviation of pain and symptom without life-shortening intention, and remained stable for non-treatment decisions. All decisions in 2001 were more often discussed with patients, their relatives and nurses. In 2001, continuous deep sedation was reported in 8.3% of deaths. We can conclude that physicians' end-of-life practices have substantially changed during the short but tumultuous legalization process of euthanasia in Belgium.

Vernakalant may have potential in the treatment of atrial arrhythmias, including acute atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Vernakalant is a mixed sodium/potassium channel blocker and selectively blocks ion channels in the heart that are known to be active during episodes of atrial fibrillation. An IV formulation of vernakalant is awaiting registration in the US for the acute conversion of atrial fibrillation. Also, an oral formulation of the compound is in phase II clinical development as a chronic-use product for the maintenance of normal heart rhythm following termination of atrial fibrillation. Cardiome is seeking co-development partners for intravenous vernakalant in the treatment of atrial arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in Europe and Japan. In October 2003, Cardiome Pharma and Fujisawa Healthcare, the US subsidiary of Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd (now Astellas Pharma), executed a $US68 million strategic partnership agreement for the co-development of vernakalant. On 1 April 2005, Fujisawa merged with Yamanouchi to form Astellas Pharma. The partnership grants Astellas Pharma exclusive commercialisation rights for vernakalant. Under the terms of the agreement, Cardiome and Astellas Pharma will co-develop vernakalant as an intravenous formulation for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter for North American markets. Astellas Pharma will be financially responsible for 75% of all future clinical development costs, with Cardiome responsible for the remaining 25% of costs. Astellas Pharma will be responsible for the development plan, NDA application (and NDA re-submission costs) and registration, along with the commercial manufacturing, marketing and sale of vernakalant. Cardiome will manage the phase III trials ACT 1 and ACT 2 and will also be responsible for the continued manufacturing of clinical supplies of vernakalant. Cardiome will receive royalties on end-user sales of vernakalant reflective of Cardiome's 25% share of development costs and other financial considerations. Product rights to the IV formulation of vernakalant for markets outside of North America and world rights to the oral formulation of vernakalant for chronic atrial fibrillation are not included within the scope of this partnership. Cardiome intends to form future additional alliances for these product opportunities or maintain such opportunities for commercialisation on its own. Cardiome and Astellas amended their agreement for vernakalant in relation to the re-submission of the NDA with the US FDA. Under the terms of the new agreement, Astellas agreed to fund 100% of the costs associated with re-submission, including engagement and external consultants. Astellas also agreed to modify the timing of the $US10 million NDA milestone to the date of resubmission. In February 2005, Cardiome Pharma received a $US6 million milestone payment from its co-development partner, Fujisawa Healthcare Inc. This milestone payment was triggered by the successful completion of ACT 1.A pivotal phase II trial demonstrated in September 2002 that vernakalant rapidly and effectively terminated recent onset atrial fibrillation and the study met both primary and secondary study endpoints. Following discussions with the FDA, Cardiome initiated three separate phase III clinical trials in order to enable Cardiome to apply for marketing approval for vernakalant. In August 2003, Cardiome Pharma commenced patient dosing in its first phase III efficacy study of vernakalant for the acute treatment of atrial fibrillation. This initial study, called ACT 1 (Atrial fibrillation Conversion Trial 1), measured the safety and efficacy of vernakalant in 416 patients with atrial arrhythmias. The placebo-controlled study was carried out in 45 centers in the US, Canada and Scandinavia. The ACT 1 study included two substudies of 60 patients with atrial flutter and 119 patients with longer term atrial fibrillation. The primary efficacy endpoint was acute conversion of atrial arrhythmia to normal heart rhythm. Cardiome commenced its second phase III efficacy study in March 2004, known as ACT 2. The ACT 2 study in post-cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass graft) patients with atrial fibrillation, evaluated the safety and efficacy of vernakalant (IV) in the termination of atrial arrhythmias in patients after cardiac surgery. Around 210 patients from 25 centres in the US, Canada and Europe were enrolled in this study. The primary efficacy endpoint was acute conversion of atrial arrhythmias to normal heart rhythm. The ACT 2 study is ongoing. The third phase III study, known as ACT 3 (Atrial arrhythmia Conversion Trial 3), was initiated by Cardiome Pharma in July 2004. In September 2005, Cardiome and Astellas reported that ACT 3 had been completed, achieving its primary endpoint, with over half of the 170 patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) who received vernakalant intravenously converting to normal heart rhythm, compared with only 4% in the placebo group. The study was being conducted by co-development partner Astellas Pharma and measured the safety and efficacy of intravenous vernakalant in recent onset atrial arrhythmia patients. The placebo-controlled study was being carried out in 276 patients in more than 50 centres throughout the world.ACT 4, a phase III safety study evaluating safety of IV vernakalant in approximately 120 AF patients from 30 centres in the US, Canada and Europe, was initiated in October 2005. Results from this trial are expected to supplement trial results from the pivotal ACT 1 and 3 trials. This study is ongoing. Cardiome Pharma successfully completed phase I studies for its controlled-release oral formulation of vernakalant in 2005.

In the literature there is no clear consensus on where this model stands - theory or philosophy. There is no intent to devalue Patricia Benner's work as it is valuable and has become widely used in nursing practice, research, education and administration. However, as a philosophy, Benner's interpretive work is more constructive. Appropriate use of this model requires an understanding of whether it is a theory or a philosophy, its underpinnings and an assessment of its development and testing. This can be accomplished by knowing the differences between a theory and a philosophy and by reviewing the ways of knowing and processes of reasoning which are necessary for skill acquisition. Much of the critique of Benner's work falls into two categories: it is not quantitative research and there are issues with the use of narratives. These will be reviewed. Judgment and understanding of the nature of Benner's model allows for its appropriate use in journal articles, research, or other projects and/or modification as necessary.""]",['eng'],"['Models, Theoretical', 'Nursing']",

The success and sustainability of ART programs will depend upon durable viral suppression, the long-term maintenance of the infected on first-line treatment regimes. This article considers the data policy that will be required to achieve durable viral suppression. The UNAIDS (Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS) ""Three Ones"" doctrine calls for one national health information strategy for countries that are scaling-up ART. This article provides a framework for standardizing national data policy. The need for standardization must be balanced with recognition that ART programs are still evolving and that excess standardization (imposing forms and electronic systems) should be avoided while best practices are developed and proven. This independent assessment of data policy for ART may be useful in the further development of routine program monitoring and targeted evaluation of durable viral suppression.']",['eng'],"['Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Database Management Systems/standards', 'Developing Countries', 'Directly Observed Therapy/standards', 'HIV Infections/drug therapy', 'HIV Infections/virology', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility/standards', 'Humans', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'United Nations']",['Antiviral Agents']

Twenty-three children with developmental dyslexia and 37 normally developing children, between the ages of 8 and 10 years, participated in the task. The results were consistent with the hypothesis in demonstrating that, despite an overall slowing in response times, dyslexic children show the same degree of implicit learning as normal readers, thus, providing evidence for an unimpaired implicit learning mechanism in dyslexic individuals. These results hold implications for the underlying mechanisms of learning, as dyslexic individuals who are impaired on explicit learning tasks, such as reading, spelling and writing, are unimpaired on implicit learning tasks.

The subjects consisted of 252 immunocompromised patients who were clinically suspected of tuberculosis (TB) infection between April 2005 and December 2006. Regarding the underlying diseases, 74 subjects had malignant diseases, 72 were undergoing immunosuppressive treatment, 52 had diabetes mellitus, 50 had chronic renal failure and four had HIV infection. While the positive rate of the QFT-TB test for the diagnosis of TB infection (TB disease or latent TB infection) was 78.1%, that of TST for TB infection was 50.0%. The QFT-TB test was significantly better than TST. However, 32 (13%) patients had an indeterminate QFT-TB result. Indeterminate findings were significantly more frequent in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (28%), especially with lymphocytopaenia in the peripheral blood, than in those who had other underlying diseases. While TST-positive and QFT-TB test-negative results were recognised in immunocompromised patients with bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination or nontuberculous mycobacterial disease, TST-negative and QFT-TB test-positive results were recognised in immunocompromised patients with a past history of TB infection. It was concluded that the QuantiFERON TB-2G test is a more useful diagnostic method for tuberculosis infection than tuberculin skin test for immunocompromised patients suspected of tuberculosis disease.

It is therefore likely that these circuits contribute to non-motor cognitive functions, but this is still a controversial issue. One approach is to examine evidence from neuropsychiatric disorders of cerebellar involvement. In this review, we narrow this search to test whether there is evidence of motor dysfunction associated with neuropsychiatric disorders consistent with disruption of cerebellar motor function. While we do find such evidence, especially in autism, schizophrenia and dyslexia, we caution that the restricted set of motor symptoms does not suggest global cerebellar dysfunction. Moreover, these symptoms may also reflect involvement of other, extra-cerebellar circuits and detailed examination of specific sub groups of individuals within each disorder may help to relate such motor symptoms to cerebellar morphology.']",['eng'],"['Cerebellum/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/complications', 'Mental Disorders/pathology', 'Movement Disorders/etiology', 'Movement Disorders/pathology']",

Although the optimal temperatures of PSII quantum efficiency and CO(2) assimilation were found to be between 25 and 32 degrees C, the maximal activation state of Rubisco was found to be between 16 and 20 degrees C in all genotypes. The Rubisco flux control coefficient was also the highest between 16 and 20 degrees C in the WT and antisense lines [>0.88 at an intercellular CO(2) pressure (Ci) of 28 Pa]. Gross photosynthesis at Ci = 28 Pa per Rubisco content in the WT between 12 and 20 degrees C was close to that of the antisense lines where high Rubisco control is present. Thus, Rubisco activity most strongly limited photosynthesis at cool temperatures. These results indicated that a selective enhancement of Rubisco content can enhance photosynthesis at cool temperatures, but in the sense line with enhanced Rubisco content Pi regeneration limitation occurred. Above 20 degrees C, the Rubisco flux control coefficient declined. This decline was associated with a decline in Rubisco activation. The activation state of Rubisco measured at each temperature decreased with increasing Rubisco content, and the slope of activation to Rubisco content was independent of temperature. We discuss the possibility that the decline in Rubisco activation at intermediate and high temperatures is part of a regulated response to a limitation in other photosynthetic processes.']",['eng'],"['Carbon Dioxide', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genotype', 'Oryza/enzymology', 'Oryza/genetics', 'Photosynthesis/genetics', 'Photosynthesis/physiology', 'Plant Leaves/metabolism', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase/genetics', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase/metabolism', 'Temperature']","['Carbon Dioxide (142M471B3J)', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.39)']"

The diagnosis of SIDS in many sudden and unexplained infant deaths has not been consistently applied nationally or, prior to July 2003, in the state of Kentucky. In order to better standardize practices in formulating the diagnosis of SIDS in cases of sudden and unexpected infant deaths, all of the Kentucky medical examiners formed a working group to collectively standardize the classification of this enigmatic type of infant death.!##!Methods!#!We conducted a retrospective review (2000-2004) of infants < 1 year who underwent complete historical review, circumstantial investigation, postmortem examination, and toxicological analysis performed at the Medical Examiners' Offices in Kentucky encompassing all deaths certified as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, positional asphyxia, overlay, and undetermined cause and manner of death.!##!Results!#!A total of 417 cases were deemed sudden unexplained infant deaths after postmortem examination at the Medical Examiners' Offices in Kentucky between 2000 and 2004. A total of 237 (56.8%) infants had been bedsharing with at least one other person when found. Prior to the SIDS classification policy change in July 2003, a significantly greater number of sudden unexpected infant death cases were deemed undetermined in both cause and manner in contrast to a smaller number classified as SIDS. After the policy change, the number of deaths classified as SIDS greatly surpassed the number classified as undetermined.!##!Conclusions!#!The increase in the number of deaths consistent with SIDS and a reciprocal decline in cases reported as undetermined cause and manner of death in Kentucky is due to the uniformity and standardization of terminology, rather than an actual increase in the number of infant deaths.

Here, the molecular mechanisms of interaction of vernakalant with the inner pore of the Kv1.5 channel are compared with those of the class IC agent flecainide. Initial experiments showed that vernakalant blocks activated channels and vacates the inner vestibule as the channel closes, and thus mutations were made, targeting residues at the base of the selectivity filter and in S6, by drawing on studies of other Kv1.5-selective blocking agents. Block by vernakalant or flecainide of Kv1.5 wild type and mutants was assessed by whole-cell patch-clamp experiments in transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The mutational scan identified several highly conserved amino acids, Thr479, Thr480, Ile502, Val505, and Val508, as important residues for affecting block by both compounds. In general, mutations in S6 increased the IC50 for block by vernakalant; I502A caused an extremely local 25-fold decrease in potency. Specific changes in the voltage-dependence of block with I502A supported the crucial role of this position. A homology model of the pore region of Kv1.5 predicted that, of these residues, only Thr479, Thr480, Val505, and Val508 are potentially accessible for direct interaction, and that mutation at additional sites studied may therefore affect block through allosteric mechanisms. For some of the mutations, the direction of changes in IC50 were opposite for vernakalant and flecainide, highlighting differences in the forces that drive drug-channel interactions.']",['eng'],"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution/genetics', 'Anisoles/chemistry', 'Anisoles/metabolism', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents/chemistry', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents/metabolism', 'Binding Sites/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Heart Atria/chemistry', 'Heart Atria/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kv1.5 Potassium Channel/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Kv1.5 Potassium Channel/chemistry', 'Kv1.5 Potassium Channel/genetics', 'Kv1.5 Potassium Channel/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Potassium Channel Blockers/chemistry', 'Potassium Channel Blockers/metabolism', 'Pyrrolidines/chemistry', 'Pyrrolidines/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']","['Anisoles', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Kv1.5 Potassium Channel', 'Potassium Channel Blockers', 'Pyrrolidines', 'vernakalant (9G468C8B13)']"

Both the number and type of higher cortical function deficits (HCFD) in acute stroke patients are important diagnostically and for gauging the extent of neurological deficits. Methods. The Stroke Data Bank (SDB) provided a large prospective data base for such evaluation. Thirty-one different HCFDs, each defined in the SDB manual, were considered. Results. Of 1,805 patients in the SDB, 641 instances of HCFD in 422 patients were recorded in alert patients at initial examination (within the first 7 to 10 days of ictus). Aphasia (41%) was the most commonly found HCFD, followed by neglect syndrome (27.2%), apraxia (11.7%), and anosognosia (11.1%). Agnosia (3.9%), alexia (3.3%), and aprosodia (1.5%) were less frequently found HCFDs. Cardioembolic infarct was most likely to have associated HCFDs (66%), and lacunar infarction was least likely to be accompanied by HCFDs (6%), with infarction caused by large artery thrombosis (50%) and infarct of undetermined cause (47%) having similar frequencies. The co-occurrence of sensory and motor deficits among the eight major subgroups of HCFD showed that neglect syndrome, apraxia, and anosognosia were most likely to be associated with long tract signs, whereas alexia, aprosodia, and agnosia invariably were not associated with sensorimotor impairment. Approximately half of aphasic patients had associated sensorimotor impairment. Conclusion. Our findings show that higher cortical function deficits are prevalent in the acute phase of stroke, particularly aphasia and neglect syndromes. They are more often associated with nonlacunar stroke and some are less likely to be associated with any sensorimotor deficits.']",['eng'],,

Participatory action research (PAR) was conducted through a cycle of planning, action, and reflection to identify effective interventions to empower participants with dementia (PsWD) and their caregivers.!##!Setting!#!A rural town in Japan.!##!Participants!#!This project involved 37 community-dwelling elderly with early or mild dementia and 31 family caregivers.!##!Methods!#!A focus group interview was used for assessment. A monthly activity-based programme based on cognitive rehabilitation was developed to improve cognitive function. Three types of data were collected: observational data collected during the activities, written comments from the caregivers, the record of phone interviews and counsellings with caregivers. These data were compiled in chronological order into a portfolio for analysis. To empower family caregivers, educational and counselling programmes were offered.!##!Results!#!The PAR lasted for 5 years and evolved over three cycles: individual, group and community. In the first cycle, the major focus of the intervention was to regain procedural skills for each PWD through a cooking programme. In the second cycle, to increase interactions with family members and with other PsWD, group activities that promoted communication among family members as well as among PsWD were implemented. The collective values and the beliefs of the PsWD's generation were validated by a series of trips to temples and shrines. In the third cycle, community participation was planned and implemented through culturally relevant sequential activities. PsWD demonstrated their expert skills and regained confidence. For family caregivers, the educational programme provided knowledge about dementia and utilization of social resources. Face-to-face and phone counsellings were offered as needed to coach problem-focused coping. These programmes helped to interpret the symptoms of dementia and to reduce the behavioural problems.!##!Conclusions!#!Cognitive rehabilitation theory was useful to restore lost procedural skills and regain confidence for PsWD. This PAR illustrated the importance of interventions for both community dwelling elderly with early dementia and their family caregivers.""]",['eng'],"['Caregivers/psychology', 'Dementia/psychology', 'Family/psychology', 'Female', 'Health Services Research', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Power (Psychology)']",

Despite controversy, many health care professionals have called for routine clinical screening of patients' literacy skills. Whereas brief literacy screening tools exist that with further evaluation could potentially be used to detect limited literacy in clinical settings, no screening program for limited literacy has been shown to be effective. Yet there is a noted potential for harm, in the form of shame and alienation, which might be induced through clinical screening. There is fair evidence to suggest that possible harm outweighs any current benefits; therefore, clinical screening for literacy should not be recommended at this time.""]",['eng'],"['Educational Status', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Mass Screening', 'Physician-Patient Relations']",
M17996505,['Long-term results after vascularised joint transfer for finger joint reconstruction.'],"[""Introduction!#!Vascularised complete joint transfer from the finger or the second toe offers the unique possibility of reconstructing a joint defect on the thumb or fingers using autologous tissue, which fully preserves its growth potential. Indications for vascularised joint transfer on the finger in children are set because of lack of therapy options offering normal growth potential. In adults vascularised joint transfer is indicated in case of contraindication for prosthetic joint replacement or arthrodesis.!##!Patients and methods!#!In a retrospective clinical study 16 vascularised joint transfers to the hand with an average follow up of 8.2 (3-15) years were evaluated. The finger joint defect was caused by trauma in 12 patients, tumour in two patients and infection and congenital deformity in one patient each. There were 14 men and two women. The mean age range was 26 (2-42) years. In six cases a partial vascularised joint transfer was carried out, with the transplant being harvested in two cases from a nonreplantable finger according to the 'tissue bank concept' according to Chase and in the other two cases from the proximal interphalangeal (PIP)-joint of the second toe. In 10 patients a complete vascularised joint transfer was carried out, with the joint being harvested from the hand in six cases and from the 2nd toe in four cases. The following criteria were evaluated: active range of motion (Neutral-0-Method), postoperative arthritis, growth and complications.!##!Results!#!The active range of motion of the transplanted joint for partial PIP joint transfer ex/flex was 0/20 degrees /65 degrees and for partial metacarpo-phalangeal (MP) joint transfer 0/20 degrees /30 degrees. After distal interphalangeal (DIP)-to-PIP joint transposition the active range of motion was measured as ex/flex 0/20 degrees /60 degrees, after PIP-to-PIP transposition 0/30 degrees /60 degrees, PIP-to-MP transposition 0/20 degrees /80 degrees and after MP-to-MP transposition 0/20 degrees /57 degrees. The results after microvascular PIP joint transfer from the 2nd toe for PIP joint reconstruction were 0/25 degrees /58 degrees for PIP joint reconstruction and 0/15 degrees /70 degrees for MP joint reconstruction. Arthritic changes could be seen in three out of four patients with partial vascularised joint transfer. In all complete joint transfers there was no clinical and radiological evidence of arthritis even after 15 years. In the two skeletally immature patients at the time of transfer, normal growth compared to the contralateral donor site could be seen. In eight out of 16 patients complications occurred. In four cases tendolysis of the extensor tendon was necessary. In four patients skeletal misalignment (3 x sagittal plane, 1 x rotation) was diagnosed. In one patient flexor pulley reconstruction was necessary in order to correct a bowstring deformity.!##!Conclusions!#!Whenever possible the 'tissue bank concept' according to CHASE should be applied in finger joint reconstruction using a vascularised joint graft from either an amputated or a redundant digit. Results of vascularised joint transfer have to be compared to those of persisting joint defect, prosthetic joint replacement, arthrodesis, or ultimately amputation of the finger involved. Patients in whom a vascularised joint transfer is anticipated should be informed about the following points: (1) The risk of failure (vascular failure, tendon adhesion, joint stiffness, etc.) is about 10%. (2) The expected active range of motion depends on aetiology, age, donor site and recipient site. Traumatic joint defects show a greater active range of motion than congenital defects. Children have more active joint motion than adults. (3) Because of minor donor site impairment and rapid recovery of normal gait the whole second ray should be amputated after harvesting of a joint graft on the second toe. (4) Hospitalisation takes 1-2 weeks. Immobilisation of the hand (palmar forearm splint) and the foot (lower leg cast) should be applied for 4 to 6 weeks. Intensive physiotherapy is necessary for at least 3 months. Additional splinting is advised for about 6 months. (5) Extensor tendolysis is necessary in a large number of cases but should not be done earlier than 6 months after transplantation.""]",['eng'],"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Arthroplasty/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Finger Injuries/surgery', 'Finger Joint/blood supply', 'Finger Joint/physiopathology', 'Finger Joint/surgery', 'Finger Joint/transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microcirculation', 'Microsurgery/methods', 'Range of Motion, Articular', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tissue Banks', 'Toe Joint/transplantation', 'Treatment Outcome']",

Reports describe suboptimal patient care on hospital wards and reasons for re-admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) but limited data exists on the occurrence of adverse events, their characteristics and outcomes in patients recently discharged from the ICU to the ward. This prospective observational study describes the incidence and outcomes of adverse events within 72 hours of discharge from an Australian ICU over 12 weeks in 2006. Patients were excluded if they were admitted to ICU after booked surgery or uncomplicated drug overdose, were discharged from ICU to the high dependency unit or had a 'do-not-resuscitate' order Clinical antecedents and preventability were determined for each event. Seventeen (10%) of the 167 discharges that met the inclusion criteria were associated with an adverse event, with nine (52%) judged as probably preventable. Seven adverse events occurred from discharges between 1700 and 0700 hours and seven were on weekends. The most common adverse events were related to fluid management (47%). Outcomes included three ICU readmissions, two high dependency unit admissions and two required one-to-one ward nursing. Two adverse events resulted in temporary disability, seven resulted in prolonged hospital stays and two were associated with death. Delay in taking action for abnormal physiological signs and infrequent charting were evident. Whilst the adverse event rate compared favourably with other reports, 64% of the events were considered preventable.

M18038529,['Multicentre study of delirium in ICU patients using a simple screening tool.'],"['Traditionally, intensive care unit (ICU) delirium was viewed as benign and was under-diagnosed in the absence of ICU-appropriate screening tools. Research suggests that up to half of all ICU patients experiencing delirium will continue to do so after discharge to the ward, and half of those experiencing delirium in the ward will die within 1 year of delirium diagnosis. ICU-specific screening tools are now available. The purpose of this study was to identify the incidence of delirium in ICU and explore its associations to clinical factors and outcomes. A secondary aim was to evaluate the usefulness of the intensive care delirium screening checklist (ICDSC). A total of 185 patients in six ICUs in Australia and New Zealand were screened for delirium using the ICDSC over two 12-hour periods per day for the duration of their ICU admission. Some 84 patients (45%) developed delirium. Development of delirium was associated with increased severity of illness (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation--APACHE II--and sequential organ failure assessment--SOFA), ICU length of stay (LOS), and use of psycho-active drugs. Delirious patients showed no statistically significant difference in ICU and hospital mortality rates, nor prolonged hospital LOS. The ICDSC was found to be user-friendly. The incidence of delirium, observed characteristics and outcomes for patients admitted to Australian and New Zealand ICUs for > 36 hours without any history of altered mental state fell in the mid-range and were generally consistent with previous literature. An ICU-specific delirium assessment, such as the ICDSC, should be included in routine ICU observations to minimise under-diagnosis of this serious phenomenon.']",['eng'],"['APACHE', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Critical Care/methods', 'Delirium/diagnosis', 'Delirium/epidemiology', 'Delirium/etiology', 'Female', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Mass Screening/methods', 'Mass Screening/standards', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Organ Failure/complications', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'New Zealand/epidemiology', 'Nursing Assessment/methods', 'Nursing Assessment/standards', 'Nursing Evaluation Research', 'Outcome Assessment (Health Care)', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychotropic Drugs/adverse effects', 'Risk Factors']",['Psychotropic Drugs']

We then searched for available quality measures that might indicate whether assisted living was meeting those goals or living up to those claims.!##!Results!#!Any meaningful concept of ""quality"" must embrace a variety of dimensions, including quality of care, quality of life, the physical environment, and resident rights. The ability to use a multidimensional concept of quality is complicated by the lack of consensus, confusion, and disagreement among consumers, providers, and regulators about the role of assisted living. This disagreement significantly confounds the task of comparing quality among assisted living settings and between assisted living and other types of long-term care.!##!Implications!#!We propose ways that researchers may compare quality along dimensions claimed to be intrinsic to assisted living as part of an effort to inform consumer information systems, quality monitoring and assurance systems, and policy-relevant research. Such comparisons would vary, depending on the intended use of the indicators and role defined for assisted living.

Here we report a novel, non-cell division function for polo kinases in embryonic polarity of newly fertilized Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. We show that polo kinases, via their polo box domains, bind to and regulate the activity of two key polarity proteins, MEX-5 and MEX-6. These polo kinases are asymmetrically localized along the anteroposterior axis of newly fertilized C. elegans embryos in a pattern identical to that of MEX-5 and MEX-6. This asymmetric localization of polo kinases depends on MEX-5 and MEX-6, as well as genes regulating MEX-5 and MEX-6 asymmetry. We identify an amino acid of MEX-5, T(186), essential for polo binding and show that T(186) is important for MEX-5 function in vivo. We also show that MBK-2, a developmentally regulated DYRK2 kinase activated at meiosis II, primes T(186) for subsequent polo kinase-dependent phosphorylation. Prior phosphorylation of MEX-5 at T(186) greatly enhances phosphorylation of MEX-5 by polo kinases in vitro. Our results provide a mechanism by which MEX-5 and MEX-6 function is temporally regulated during the crucial oocyte-to-embryo transition.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Body Patterning', 'Caenorhabditis elegans/embryology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans/enzymology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans/genetics', 'Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins/chemistry', 'Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Polarity', 'Cytoplasm/enzymology', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/cytology', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/enzymology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Genes, Helminth', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Germ Cells', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphothreonine/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases/chemistry', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism']","['Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'MEX-5 protein, C elegans', 'MEX-6 protein, C elegans', 'Phosphothreonine (1114-81-4)', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins (147336-22-9)', 'Dyrk kinase (EC 2.7.1.-)', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases (EC 2.7.10.1)', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases (EC 2.7.11.1)', 'plk-1 protein, C elegans (EC 2.7.11.21)']"

M18217181,['Molecular evolution of arthropod color vision deduced from multiple opsin genes of jumping spiders.'],"['Among terrestrial animals, only vertebrates and arthropods possess wavelength-discrimination ability, so-called ""color vision"". For color vision to exist, multiple opsins which encode visual pigments sensitive to different wavelengths of light are required. While the molecular evolution of opsins in vertebrates has been well investigated, that in arthropods remains to be elucidated. This is mainly due to poor information about the opsin genes of non-insect arthropods. To obtain an overview of the evolution of color vision in Arthropoda, we isolated three kinds of opsins, Rh1, Rh2, and Rh3, from two jumping spider species, Hasarius adansoni and Plexippus paykulli. These spiders belong to Chelicerata, one of the most distant groups from Hexapoda (insects), and have color vision as do insects. Phylogenetic analyses of jumping spider opsins revealed a birth and death process of color vision evolution in the arthropod lineage. Phylogenetic positions of jumping spider opsins revealed that at least three opsins had already existed before the Chelicerata-Pancrustacea split. In addition, sequence comparison between jumping spider Rh3 and the shorter wavelength-sensitive opsins of insects predicted that an opsin of the ancestral arthropod had the lysine residue responsible for UV sensitivity. These results strongly suggest that the ancestral arthropod had at least trichromatic vision with a UV pigment and two visible pigments. Thereafter, in each pancrustacean and chelicerate lineage, the opsin repertoire was reconstructed by gene losses, gene duplications, and function-altering amino acid substitutions, leading to evolution of color vision.']",['eng'],"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Color Perception/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Rod Opsins/chemistry', 'Rod Opsins/classification', 'Rod Opsins/genetics', 'Rod Opsins/radiation effects', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Spiders/classification', 'Spiders/genetics', 'Ultraviolet Rays']","['DNA, Complementary', 'Rod Opsins']"

We used a strategy to identify the level of open-lung PEEP (OLP) by detecting the maximum tidal compliance during a decremental PEEP trial (DPT). We performed a randomized controlled study to compare the effect of the OLP to PEEP above LIP and zero PEEP on pulmonary mechanics, gas exchange, hemodynamic change, and lung injury in 26 rabbits with ALI. After recruitment maneuver, the lavage-injured rabbits received DPTs to identify the OLP. Animals were randomized to receive volume controlled ventilation with either: (a) PEEP = 0 cm H2O (ZEEP); (b) PEEP = 2 cm H2O above OLP (OLP + 2); or (c) PEEP = 2 cm H2O above LIP (LIP + 2). Peak inspiratory pressure and mean airway pressure were recorded and arterial blood gases were analyzed every 30 min. Mean blood pressure and heart rate were monitored continuously. Lung injury severity was assessed by lung wet/dry weight ratio. Animals in OLP + 2 group had less lung injury as well as relatively better compliance, more stable pH, and less hypercapnia compared to the LIP + 2 and ZEEP groups. We concluded that setting PEEP according to the OLP identified by DPTs is an effective method to attenuate lung injury. This strategy could be used as an indicator for optimal PEEP. The approach is simple and noninvasive and may be of clinical interest.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Heart Rate', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hypercapnia', 'Lung/physiopathology', 'Lung Compliance', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Positive-Pressure Respiration/methods', 'Pulmonary Gas Exchange', 'Rabbits', 'Random Allocation', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult/therapy', 'Respiratory Mechanics', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Tidal Volume', 'Total Lung Capacity']",

The patients' case files and ICU records were used to extract the necessary data. During the study period, there were a total of 4857 deliveries, with 5051 total births (including multiple births) and 4854 live births. Forty eclamptics were admitted to the ICU, giving an ICU admission rate of 8.2/1000 live births. The records of two patients were incomplete. The average age of the patients was 28.4 years (range 17-4 years). Six patients (15.8%) were booked and 32 (84.2%) were not. The average duration of stay in ICU was 5 days. Twenty patients (52.6%) had antepartum eclampsia, 12 (31.6%) had postpartum eclampsia and six (15.8%) presented with intrapartum eclampsia. Twenty-nine (76.3%) gave birth via caesarean section and nine (23.7%) delivered per vagina augmented by oxytocin infusion. Seventeen (45%) received mechanical ventilation; 20 (53%) received oxygen via nasal prongs, nasal catheters or variable performance facemask. One patient (2%) did not receive oxygen therapy. All the patients were admitted postpartum. There were 11 maternal deaths, giving a case fatality rate of 29%. There were five (45.4%) deaths due to haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count syndrome and two (18.2%) due to disseminated intravascular coagulation. The remaining deaths were due to cerebrovascular accident (9.1%), lobar pneumonia (9.1%), acute renal failure (9.1%) and multiple organ failure (9.1%). All patients were admitted postpartum. This fatality rate is higher than that detailed in the reports reviewed in this study. Early referral of eclamptics or at risk patients to a tertiary care institution may help reduce morbidity and mortality. In addition, early referral to a facility providing basic essential obstetric care or comprehensive essential obstetric care is also important. Another important factor is the correct diagnosis of pre-eclampsia during antenatal and postpartum care by screening, noting blood pressure levels, performing urinalysis for protein and asking about warning signs such as headache, blurred vision, epigastric pain, etc.""]",['eng'],"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Critical Care', 'Eclampsia/mortality', 'Eclampsia/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Nigeria/epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Retrospective Studies']",

M18353762,['Association of Rubisco activase with chaperonin-60beta: a possible mechanism for protecting photosynthesis during heat stress.'],"['Previous studies have shown that inhibition of photosynthesis by moderate heat stress is a consequence of Rubisco deactivation, caused in part by the thermal instability of Rubisco activase. This involvement of Rubisco activase was confirmed in heat stress and recovery experiments using transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Compared with wild-type plants, photosynthesis, the effective quantum yield of photosystem II, and Rubisco activation were less thermotolerant and recovered more slowly in transgenic Arabidopsis plants with reduced levels of Rubisco activase. Immunoblots showed that 65% of the Rubisco activase was recovered in the insoluble fraction after heat stress in leaf extracts of transgenic but not wild-type plants, evidence that deactivation of Rubisco was a consequence of thermal denaturation of Rubisco activase. The transgenic Arabidopsis plants used in this study contained a modified form of Rubisco activase that facilitated affinity purification of Rubisco activase and proteins that potentially interact with Rubisco activase during heat stress. Sequence analysis and immunoblotting identified the beta-subunit of chaperonin-60 (cpn60beta), the chloroplast GroEL homologue, as a protein that was bound to Rubisco activase from leaf extracts prepared from heat-stressed, but not control plants. Analysis of the proteins by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis showed that cpn60beta was associated with Rubisco activase in a high molecular mass complex. Immunoblot analysis established that the apparent association of cpn60beta with Rubisco activase was dynamic, increasing with the duration and intensity of the heat stress and decreasing following recovery. Taken together, these data suggest that cpn60beta plays a role in acclimating photosynthesis to heat stress, possibly by protecting Rubisco activase from thermal denaturation.']",['eng'],"['Adaptation, Physiological/physiology', 'Arabidopsis/genetics', 'Arabidopsis/metabolism', 'Chaperonin 60/chemistry', 'Chaperonin 60/metabolism', 'Chlorophyll/chemistry', 'Chlorophyll/metabolism', 'Fluorescence', 'Hot Temperature', 'Photosynthesis/physiology', 'Plant Proteins/metabolism', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Protein Binding']","['Chaperonin 60', 'Plant Proteins', 'rca protein, plant', 'Chlorophyll (1406-65-1)']"

The first assessment was at least 10 days after surgery and prior to adjuvant therapy, as well as before the MBSR start-up. Further assessments were mid-MBSR, at completion of MBSR, and at 4-week post-MBSR completion. Women with breast cancer enrolled in the control group (Non-MBSR) were assessed at similar times. At the first assessment (i.e., before MBSR start), reductions in peripheral blood mononuclear cell NK cell activity (NKCA) and IFN-gamma production with increases in IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 production and plasma cortisol levels were observed for both the MBSR and Non-MBSR groups of breast cancer patients. Over time women in the MBSR group re-established their NKCA and cytokine production levels. In contrast, breast cancer patients in the Non-MBSR group exhibited continued reductions in NKCA and IFN-gamma production with increased IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 production. Moreover, women enrolled in the MBSR program had reduced cortisol levels, improved QOL, and increased coping effectiveness compared to the Non-MBSR group.

The SBAR (Situation-Background-Assessment-Recommendation) process has proven to be an effective communication tool in acute care settings to structure high-urgency communications, particularly between physicians and nurses; however, little is known of its effectiveness in other settings. This study evaluated the effectiveness of an adapted SBAR tool for both urgent and non-urgent situations within a rehabilitation setting. In phase 1 of this study, clinical staff, patient and family input was gathered in a focus-group format to help guide, validate and refine adaptations to the SBAR tool. In phase 2, the adapted SBAR was implemented in one interprofessional team; clinical and support staff participated in educational workshops with experiential learning to enhance their proficiency in using the SBAR process. Key champions reinforced its use within the team. In phase 3, evaluation of the effectiveness of the adapted SBAR tool focused on three main areas: staff perceptions of team communication and patient safety culture (as measured by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture), patient satisfaction (as determined using the Client Perspectives on Rehabilitation Services questionnaire) and safety reporting (including incident and near-miss reporting). Findings from this study suggest that staff found the use of the adapted SBAR tool helpful in both individual and team communications, which ultimately affected perceived changes in the safety culture of the study team. There was a positive but not significant impact on patient satisfaction, likely due to a ceiling effect. Improvements were also seen in safety reporting of incidents and near misses across the organization and within the study team.']",['eng'],"['Humans', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Interprofessional Relations', 'Program Evaluation', 'Rehabilitation Centers', 'Safety Management', 'Teaching/organization & administration', 'Total Quality Management']",

Synergism of apoptosis induction was also observed in U251 cells when coexposing cells to other HDAC inhibitors, including LAQ824 and trichostatin A, with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, thus demonstrating a class effect. In U251 cells, bortezomib alone or in combination with LBH589 decreased Raf-1 levels and suppressed Akt and Erk activation. LBH589 or bortezomib alone increased expression of the cell cycle regulators p21 and p27. Additionally, the combination, but not the individual agents, markedly enhanced JNK activation. Synergistic induction of apoptosis after exposure to LBH589 and bortezomib was partially mediated by Bax translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria resulting from Bax conformational changes. Bax translocation precedes cytochrome c release and apoptosis, and selective down-regulation of Bax using siRNA significantly mitigates the cytotoxicity of LBH589 and bortezomib.

As tube feeding is directly delivered to the transverse colon, patients typically present with a sudden onset of transient diarrhea within minutes after PEG tube feeding. A radiographic study using water-soluble contrast material via the PEG tube shows the tip of the tube in the transverse colon. We present here a patient who had this complication after PEG insertion. A PEG tube for enteral feeding was placed in a 27-year-old man with cerebral plasty and a severe scoliosis. After replacement of the PEG tube, he developed diarrhea after each PEG tube feeding. The diagnosis of gastrocolocutaneous fistula was made after injection of gastrografin from the PEG tube. Another gastrostomy tube was placed surgically and the fistula was then also excised.

Thereafter, they received a standardised training of 6 weeks of daily auditory exercises aimed at reinforcing explicit and implicit phonological awareness. Ten participants also received specific training of the sensory-motor aspects of articulatory production of individual phonemes during the first 3 weeks of auditory training, whereas the remaining received the same specific training during the last 3 weeks of auditory training. Repetition, phonological awareness, reading and spelling were assessed before the first session, between the two sessions and after the second session. Results confirm the overall efficiency of intensive phonological training, even with exclusively auditory material. The main outcome of this study is a significant improvement of phonology and non-word reading specifically during the periods where the two methods were associated, suggesting a significant contribution of articulatory training to the observed improvement. Finally performance to a motor tapping task proved to be one of the best predictors of training efficiency while comorbid co-ordination or attention deficit did not interfere. Results are interpreted with reference to current theories about mechanisms underlying dyslexia.']",['eng'],"['Analysis of Variance', 'Awareness', 'Child', 'Dyslexia/rehabilitation', 'Feedback, Psychological', 'Humans', 'Language Tests', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Phonetics', 'Reading', 'Speech Therapy/methods', 'Teaching', 'Time Factors', 'Voice Training']",

A retrospective analysis of 187 patients to compare the complications and associated predictive factors of the two techniques of one level lumbar fusion. Ninety-one had PLIF with two cages and pedicle fixation (group 1), and ninety-six had TLIF with one cage and pedicle fixation (group 2). The two groups had similar age and sex distribution, and level of pain. Inclusion criteria and outcome measurements were identical in both groups. The two groups were operated on with autograft and cage with pedicle fixation. Before surgery and at the 2-year follow-up, pain (VAS) and functional disability (JOA) were quantified. The results showed there were no intraoperative deaths in our study. In the end 176 cases had 2-year follow-up while 11 cases were lost to follow-up. The follow-up rate was 93.4% (85/91) in the PLIF group and 94.8% (91/96) in the TLIF group. All patients had bone fusion, and there were no cases of cage extrusion. The pain index improved from 7.08 +/- 1.13 to 2.84 +/- 0.89 in PLIF patients and improved from 7.18 +/- 1.09 to 2.84 +/- 0.91 in TLIF patients (P < 0.001). There were 42 cases of excellent, 29 cases of good, 11 cases of general, and 3 cases of poor results in PLIF group. There were 46 cases of excellent, 31 case of good, 12 case of general, and 2 cases of poor results in TLIF group. The JOA score in all patients was 84.1% of good or excellent (83.5% in PLIF and 84.6% in TLIF, P > 0.05). The average preoperative slip was 30.1 +/- 7.2% in PLIF group while in the TLIF it was 31.4 +/- 8.3%. Immediately post operatively it was reduced to 7.3 +/- 2.1% and 7.4 +/- 2.7% and at last F/U it was 8.1 +/- 2.8% and 8.2 +/- 2.6%, respectively. The average of reduction rate was 75.2 +/- 6.4% in PLIF and 75.4 +/- 6.2 in TLIF on the initial post operatively X-ray, and 72.6 +/- 5.2% and 72.4 +/- 5.4% on the follow-up. The percentage rate, reduction rate and lost of reduction rate between the two groups was similar (P > 0.05). The average pre operative disk and foramen height in the PLIF group improved from 6.8 +/- 2.3 and 14.2 +/- 1.7 preoperatively to 11.6 +/- 1.5 and 18.7 +/- 1.8 post operatively, respectively. At last follow up there was minimal lost of correction down to 11.24 +/- 1.2 and 18.1 +/- 1.8, respectively. Similarly in the TLIF group, pre operative disk and foramen height were improved from 6.7 +/- 1.7 and 14.1 +/- 1.8 to 11.4 +/- 1.6 and 18.5 +/- 1.6 immediately post operative. At last follow up minimal lost of correction was noted with average disc height of 11.3 +/- 1.4 and 18.2 +/- 1.7. Both techniques achieve statistical significance in restoration of disc and foraminal (P < 0.01); however, there was no statistical difference between the two techniques.

Literature review was performed using web-based online search engines and library resources.!##!Results!#!The response rate from the surgeons was high (75%). Almost 94% of respondents recommended antibiotic prophylaxis for prosthetic joint patients prior to invasive dental treatment as a general principle and 90% of respondents considered that antibiotic prophylaxis was necessary as long as there was a prosthetic joint in situ. The majority of clinicians follow the AHA guidelines; that is, a single preoperative oral dose of 2 g amoxicillin or 600 mg clindamycin if the patient was allergic to penicillin. Over half did not recommend a 6-hour postoperative dose. Patients with medical conditions placing them ""at-risk"" of prosthetic joint infection were correctly identified by most orthopaedic surgeons especially those with diabetes and other forms of immunosuppression. The setting in which dental surgery was performed was not seen as being important. No randomised controlled trials were identified and currently no definite scientific evidence exists for the systematic use of prophylactic antibiotics before dental procedures in patients with prosthetic joints. In view of the high clinical cost of bacterial infection in cardiac and prosthetic joint patients, most guidelines currently favour the use of prophylactic antibiotics before invasive dental procedures in all patients within 2 years of the index surgery and high risk patients for the rest of their life.!##!Conclusions!#!In the absence of level 1 evidence for or against the use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with prosthetic joints undergoing invasive dental treatment, the most recent ADA/AAOS guidelines provide the best available advice for dental practitioners and their patients.

Based on 30-cluster sampling recommended by WHO, a total of 1640 individuals belonging to 294 families from 30 villages were enrolled in the study. Demographic and socio-economic details of all individuals and families were recorded. Individuals with AE were identified by door-to-door survey. NCC was diagnosed by clinical, immunological, neuroimaging (brain magnetic resonance imaging) and epidemiological criteria. During the survey, 95 (5.8%) patients with AE were identified and clinically confirmed; 91 agreed to further evaluation for NCC and 44 (48.3%) of them fulfilled either definitive or probable diagnostic criteria for NCC. These 44 patients belonged to 37 households. Epilepsy in the family and no separate place for keeping pigs were identified as risk factors for NCC clustering in a family. The study shows a very high prevalence of AE in the pig farming community and NCC as its major cause.

Using the remnant kidney model of chronic kidney disease in rats, we measured the effects of combined angiotensin II blockade with captopril and losartan on renal oxygen consumption (QO(2)) and factors influencing QO(2). Remnant kidneys had proteinuria and reductions in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal blood flow (RBF) and nitric oxide synthase-1 protein expression while QO(2), factored by sodium reabsorption (QO(2)/TNa), was markedly increased. Combined blockade treatment normalized these parameters while increasing sodium reabsorption but, since QO(2) was unchanged, QO(2)/TNa also normalized. Triple antihypertensive therapy, to control blood pressure, and treatment with lysine, to increase GFR and RBF, did not normalize QO(2)/TNa, suggesting a specific effect of angiotensin II in elevating QO(2)/TNa. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase increased QO(2) in the kidney of sham-operated rats but not in the remnant kidney of untreated rats. Our study shows that combined captopril and losartan treatment normalized QO(2)/TNa and functional nitric oxide activity in the remnant kidney independent of blood pressure and GFR effects, suggesting that other mechanisms in addition to hemodynamics underlie the benefits of angiotensin II blockade.']",['eng'],"['Angiotensin II/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Angiotensin II/physiology', 'Animals', 'Captopril/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Kidney Diseases/metabolism', 'Losartan/pharmacology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Rats', 'Sodium/metabolism']","['Angiotensin II (11128-99-7)', 'Captopril (9G64RSX1XD)', 'Sodium (9NEZ333N27)', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase (EC 1.14.13.39)', 'Losartan (JMS50MPO89)']"

The pharmacokinetics of vernakalant were explored in healthy volunteers and in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in 4 clinical studies. Key pharmacokinetic parameters analyzed were the maximum plasma concentration and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve. Vernakalant exhibited linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 0.1 mg/kg to 5.0 mg/kg in healthy subjects, and generally showed dose proportionality in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter who received 1 or 2 vernakalant infusions. Vernakalant was metabolized rapidly via 4-O-demethylation by cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 to its major metabolite RSD1385, which then circulated predominantly as an inactive glucuronide conjugate. In most patients, the maximum plasma concentration of RSD1385 glucuronide exceeded that of vernakalant. Unconjugated RSD1385 was found at low levels in all patients demonstrating either a cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 ""extensive metabolizer"" or ""poor metabolizer"" phenotype or genotype; however, CYP2D6 poor metabolizers had even lower levels of unconjugated RSD1385. The impact of CYP2D6 metabolizer status on vernakalant exposure was explored in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter who received a therapeutic regimen (3 mg/kg initially via 10-minute intravenous infusion followed by a second 2 mg/kg 10-minute infusion if atrial fibrillation persisted after a 15-minute observation period). In the subset that received 2 vernakalant infusions, there was little difference in vernakalant maximum plasma concentration or area under the plasma concentration-time curve from the start of the first infusion to 90 minutes between CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers or between those who did or did not receive concomitant CYP2D6-inhibitor medications. Gender, age, and renal function did not have a clinically significant influence on the pharmacokinetics of vernakalant. These results suggest that an assessment of CYP2D6 expression may not be needed when vernakalant is administered acutely and intravenously to patients with atrial fibrillation.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anisoles/administration & dosage', 'Anisoles/pharmacokinetics', 'Anisoles/therapeutic use', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents/administration & dosage', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents/pharmacokinetics', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents/therapeutic use', 'Atrial Fibrillation/drug therapy', 'Atrial Fibrillation/physiopathology', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/administration & dosage', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/biosynthesis', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Heart Atria', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pyrrolidines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrrolidines/pharmacokinetics', 'Pyrrolidines/therapeutic use', 'Sex Factors', 'Single-Blind Method', 'Young Adult']","['Anisoles', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Pyrrolidines', 'vernakalant (9G468C8B13)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 (EC 1.14.14.1)']"

A high point of his thinking was the development of the Q-cycle model that advanced our understanding of cytochrome bc (1). While the principle tenets of his Q-cycle still hold true today, Mitchell did not explain the specific mechanism that allows the Qo site to perform this Q-cycle efficiently without undue energy loss. Though much speculation on Qo site mode of molecular action and regulation has been introduced over the 30 years after Mitchell collected his Prize, no single mechanism has been universally accepted. The mystery behind the Qo site mechanism remains unsolved due to elusive kinetic intermediates during Qo site electron transfer that have not been detected spectroscopically. Therefore, to reveal the Qo mechanism, we must look beyond traditional steady-state experimental approaches by changing cytochrome bc (1) thermodynamics and promoting otherwise transient Qo site redox states.']",['eng'],"['Binding Sites', 'Electron Transport Complex III/chemistry', 'Electron Transport Complex III/history', 'Electron Transport Complex III/metabolism', 'History, 20th Century', 'Iron/chemistry', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Proton-Motive Force/physiology', 'Sulfur/chemistry', 'Thermodynamics']","['Sulfur (70FD1KFU70)', 'Iron (E1UOL152H7)', 'Electron Transport Complex III (EC 1.10.2.2)']"

The main constituents of turmeric are curcumin and its analogues, which are well-known antioxidant compounds. In the present study, we hypothesized that turmeric in curry might increase bowel motility and activate hydrogen-producing bacterial flora in the colon, thereby increasing the concentration of breath hydrogen. Eight healthy subjects fasted for 12 h and ingested curry and rice with or without turmeric (turmeric knockout curry). Breath-hydrogen concentrations were analyzed every 15 min for 6 h by gas chromatography with a semiconductor detector. Curry with turmeric significantly increased the area under the curve of breath hydrogen and shortened small-bowel transit time, compared with curry not containing turmeric.

This paper describes an innovative approach developed in collaboration with practitioners to assist in revealing hitherto hidden aspects of knowing nursing. The interpretive paradigm provides one means of voicing nursing knowledge, specifically by accessing the lived-experience of nursing. The approach is qualitatively different to reflection and critical incident as it focuses on the taken-for-granted rather than being problem based or problem solving. Hermeneutic phenomenology and constructivism are combined in an innovative model that allows experience to be captured and meaning to be explored, thereby providing a means to articulate knowing in practice. Practitioners involved in operationalising this model considered that it allowed them to articulate a level of practice knowledge which they had previously experienced difficulty in accessing. This approach to knowledge articulation may therefore be useful in assisting to widen the horizon of nursing knowledge.']",['eng'],,

M19045328,['On the assumptions underlying milestoning.'],"['Milestoning is a procedure to compute the time evolution of complicated processes such as barrier crossing events or long diffusive transitions between predefined states. Milestoning reduces the dynamics to transition events between intermediates (the milestones) and computes the local kinetic information to describe these transitions via short molecular dynamics (MD) runs between the milestones. The procedure relies on the ability to reinitialize MD trajectories on the milestones to get the right kinetic information about the transitions. It also rests on the assumptions that the transition events between successive milestones and the time lags between these transitions are statistically independent. In this paper, we analyze the validity of these assumptions. We show that sets of optimal milestones exist, i.e., sets such that successive transitions are indeed statistically independent. The proof of this claim relies on the results of transition path theory and uses the isocommittor surfaces of the reaction as milestones. For systems in the overdamped limit, we also obtain the probability distribution to reinitialize the MD trajectories on the milestones, and we discuss why this distribution is not available in closed form for systems with inertia. We explain why the time lags between transitions are not statistically independent even for optimal milestones, but we show that working with such milestones allows one to compute mean first passage times between milestones exactly. Finally, we discuss some practical implications of our results and we compare milestoning with Markov state models in view of our findings.']",['eng'],"['Kinetics', 'Models, Chemical', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Surface Properties', 'Time Factors']",

It is easily shown that interventions that undoubtedly improve quality of life, such as Epogen for chemotherapy anemia, will not have an important impact on items in some validated quality of life scales (e.g. ""I trust my doctor"") and therefore will not improve quality of life scores. Investigators are advised to move beyond ""validation"" as a criterion for choosing quality of life endpoints and focus instead on the specific content of different potential measures. A particularly important concern is whether a prior trial showing a statistically significant difference on a specific quality of life scale is published, as this would demonstrate that scores on the scale will improve if patients respond to treatment.

In most cases, when posterior cage migration follows posterior lumbar interbody fusion, emergency revision surgery is required. One recent study reported a case of posterior cage migration after TLIF, which was treated conservatively.!##!Methods!#!Posterior migration of the bullet-shaped fusion cages occurred 1 to 2 months after TLIF in 3 patients.

The other 2 patients had degenerative scoliosis and were treated by TLIF with unilateral pedicle screw fixation.!##!Results!#!The patient with isthmic spondylolisthesis required revision surgery because the migrated cage caused nerve root irritation. The migrated cage was removed and a large-sized cage was employed to achieve stability. The other 2 patients had no pathologic symptoms after the posterior migration of the cage and were treated conservatively and observed.!##!Conclusion!#!Revision surgery after TLIF appears relatively safe because the migrated cage tends to locate more laterally than in patients with cage migration after posterior lumbar interbody fusion. Cage migration subsequent to TLIF may not cause compression of neural tissues, so conservative treatment may suffice for these patients. Unilateral pedicle screw fixation may not provide sufficient stability to prevent cage migration in patients with degenerative scoliosis.

A quasi-static P-V curve was then performed using the supersyringe method; PEEP was set to 20 cmH(2)O and a RM performed with pressure control ventilation (inspiratory pressure set to 40-50 cmH(2)O), until PaO(2) + PaCO(2) > 400 mmHg.

The aim of this project was to establish the feasibility of routine delirium screening using the CAM-ICU and to identify the incidence of delirium in a UK critical care unit.!##!Methods!#!Routine CAM-ICU monitoring was implemented in a mixed critical care unit in January 2007 following a two-month educational and promotional campaign. Guidelines for the management of delirium were introduced. During a two-month prospective audit in September and October 2007, the daily CAM-ICU was recorded by the bedside nurse for consecutive level 2 and level 3 patients admitted to the mixed medical/surgical critical care ward in a district general hospital. This was repeated in January 2008. Patient outcome was recorded. The records of an additional cohort of ventilated patients were reviewed retrospectively to determine compliance with routine CAM-ICU assessments.!##!Results!#!Seventy-one patients were included in the observational cohort, with 60 patients in the retrospective cohort. In the prospective group it was not possible to assess for delirium with the CAM-ICU in nine patients due to persistent coma or inability to understand simple instructions. Excluding elective post-operative patients, the incidence of delirium was 45% in patients who could be assessed; in the 27 ventilated patients who could be assessed it was 63%. From the retrospective data compliance with the CAM-ICU assessment was 92%. The incidence of delirium in this retrospective group of ventilated patients who could be assessed was 65%.!##!Conclusions!#!We have demonstrated that delirium screening is feasible in a UK ICU population.

Information on clinical experience is supported by examples from patient observation. As the examples demonstrate, through therapeutic climbing in movement therapy the patients are brought into contact with their unconscious behaviour and relationship patterns and with the manner in which they deal with situations and people. In addition to the correlates of perception of emotion and body sensation, further topics and transfers come into the frame. Positive experiences are contrasted with automatic negative cognitive processes as the result of learning and socialisation. In this context it is important to emphasise the special therapeutic relationship formation during therapeutic climbing, which provides the patient with the chance of a positive relationship experience.']",['ger'],"['Activities of Daily Living/psychology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anxiety Disorders/psychology', 'Anxiety Disorders/rehabilitation', 'Depressive Disorder/psychology', 'Depressive Disorder/rehabilitation', 'Exercise Therapy/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Illness Behavior', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Motivation', 'Mountaineering', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Psychophysiologic Disorders/rehabilitation', 'Resistance Training', 'Self Efficacy']",

At the individual level, two participants did not show any change, 1 participant had higher and one lower excitability 24 hours after cast removal. Daily rTMS over motor cortex is feasible during casting and may modify neuroplastic changes occurring during limb disuse.

It may be responsible for serious preharvest diseases and postharvest losses in fruits, vegetables and flowers. In this work, several B. cinerea isolates from ornamental plants (Chamelaucium uncinatum, Pelargonium x hortorum, Euphorbia pulcherrima, Lantana camara, Lonicera japonica, Hydrangea macrophylla, and Cyclamen persicum) affected by Botrytis blight in the south of Spain were studied. All the isolates were confirmed as B. cinerea by PCR using a specific 750-bp molecular marker, which is present in all strains of this species but absent from other species of Botrytis. The isolates were evaluated by reference to mature conidia length, sclerotia production, and growth rate. Conidia, conidiophores and hyphae were described by light microscopy and some by cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (Cryo-SEM). Conidium length was measured by using an eyepiece micrometer at 400x power, whereas the growth rate was assessed from differences in colony diameter between the third and fourth day of growth in potato-dextrose agar culture medium at 26 degrees C. B. cinerea showed a high degree of phenotypical variability among isolates, not only as regards visual aspects of the colonies but also in some morphological structures such as conidium length, conidiophores, sclerotia production, and hyphae. Differences were also observed in the growth rates. Conidiation was insignificant in the isolates from H. macrophylla, and P. x hortorum, where the overall appearance was white in all the growing stages, whereas isolates from L. camara, C. persicum and C. uncinatum were mainly grey or brown in mature stages. The longest conidia were obtained in isolates from H. macrophylla and C. persicum (17-18 microm) and the lowest in C. uncinatum (9 microm). All the isolates, except L. camara, developed mature sclerotia after approximately 16 days in the conditions used. H. macrophylla had around 72 sclerotia per colony, whereas C. persicum had only nine after 28 days. The growth rate of isolates from L. camara was the highest (1.64 cm/day). Such phenotypical variability may result in a differential response to plant growth regulators if plants are infected by Botrytis in the early stages of growth. In this way, we confirm, as we have done in other published studies, that isolates show different responses to some plant hormones and inhibitors.']",['eng'],"['Botrytis/classification', 'Botrytis/genetics', 'Botrytis/isolation & purification', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy/methods', 'Genes, Fungal', 'Genetic Variation', 'Hyphae', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Plant Diseases/microbiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Spain', 'Species Specificity', 'Spores, Fungal/genetics', 'Spores, Fungal/growth & development', 'Spores, Fungal/ultrastructure']",

The subgroups of FI are enzymatic (e.g. lactose intolerance due to lactase deficiency), pharmacological (reactions against biogenic amines, histamine intolerance), and undefined food intolerance (e.g. against some food additives). The diagnosis of an IgE-mediated FA is made by a carefully taken case history, supported by the demonstration of an IgE sensitization either by skin prick tests or by in vitro tests, and confirmed by positive oral provocation. For scientific purposes the only accepted test for the confirmation of FA/FI is a properly performed double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). A panel of recombinant allergens, produced as single allergenic molecules, may in future improve the diagnosis of IgE-mediated FA.

First, we aimed to investigate whether postural control was impaired in dyslexic children when cognitive demands are increased. Second, we checked whether this effect could be reduced significantly by a treatment aiming to recalibrate ocular proprioception. Twelve dyslexic and fifteen treated dyslexic children (>3 months of treatment) were compared with twelve non-dyslexic children in two conditions (mean age: 11.6+/-2.1, 12.5+/-1.5 and 10.6+/-1.7 years respectively). In a first condition they maintained balance while fixating a point in front of them. In the second condition the postural task was combined with a silently reading one. Balance was assessed by means of a force plate. Results demonstrated that the mean velocity (i.e. the total length) of the center of pressure (CoP) displacement was increased in the reading task only for the dyslexic group. Interestingly, for the treated children, an inverse tendency was observed: the mean velocity (i.e. the total length) and the surface of the 90% confidence ellipse of the CoP displacement decreased for 13/15 patients and for 12/15 patients respectively, while performing the reading task. Values remained similar to those observed for the control children. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that cognitive demands can impair postural control in developmental dyslexia but this interaction could be normalized.

From this initial group, 23 were identified with ADHD without ODD/CD (ADHD alone), 22 had ADHD and ODD and 20 had ADHD and CD. All the children were medication naive. Twenty-five healthy control children were also recruited from local primary schools. The four groups did not differ in age, gender or full-scale IQ. A cross-sectional study of parent- and teacher-reported ADHD and externalizing symptoms, spatial span, spatial working memory, visuospatial memory, spatial recognition, spatial planning and behavioural inhibition was completed.!##!Results!#!Parent-reported externalizing symptoms were higher in the ADHD + CD and ADHD + ODD groups compared to the ADHD alone group. There were no differences in neurocognitive function between children with ADHD-CT with and without ODD or CD. All the ADHD groups, however, performed worse than the healthy control group. Further, worse spatial span, spatial working memory and delayed matching to sample performance were associated with increased teacher-reported ADHD symptoms in the ADHD alone group. Also, worse spatial working memory performance was associated with increased teacher-reported ADHD symptoms in the ADHD + CD group.!##!Conclusions!#!ADHD symptom severity is associated with the magnitude of impairment in executive functions in children with ADHD alone, but these relationships can be obscured by the presence of comorbid disruptive disorders. Children with ADHD + CD may demonstrate similar associations to children with ADHD alone, suggesting a similar underlying dysfunction. ADHD + ODD, however, may be better understood as a maladaptive response to the abnormal behaviours and neurocognitive functions in ADHD.']",['eng'],"['Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/complications', 'Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/diagnosis', 'Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/psychology', 'Attention Deficit and Disruptive Behavior Disorders/complications', 'Attention Deficit and Disruptive Behavior Disorders/psychology', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Conduct Disorder/complications', 'Conduct Disorder/psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Severity of Illness Index']",

Why some lymphomas are resistant is incompletely understood. In the present study, we demonstrated that rapamycin inhibits mTORC1 in DLBCL lines and primary tumors but is minimally cytotoxic. Subsequent investigations revealed that rapamycin also activated eIF4E and the mTORC2 target Akt, suggesting a potential mechanism of rapamycin resistance. Furthermore, knockdown of the mTORC2 component rictor, but not the mTORC1 component raptor, inhibited rapamycin-induced Akt phosphorylation in lymphoma cells. Addition of the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDI) LBH589 (LBH) overcame rapamycin resistance by blocking mTOR, thus preventing Akt activation. Further studies support the involvement of the protein phosphatase PP1 in LBH-mediated Akt dephosphorylation, which could be mimicked by knockdown of HDAC3. This is the first demonstration that a HDI such as LBH can overcome rapamycin resistance through a phosphatase that antagonizes mTORC2 activation. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for a clinical trial of a combination of HDI and mTOR inhibitors for DLBCL.']",['eng'],"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Indoles', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']","['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'CRTC2 protein, human', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Hydroxamic Acids', 'Indoles', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Proteins', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Transcription Factors', 'panobinostat (9647FM7Y3Z)', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases (EC 2.7.1.1)', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (EC 2.7.11.1)', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt (EC 2.7.11.1)', 'Histone Deacetylases (EC 3.5.1.98)', 'Sirolimus (W36ZG6FT64)']"

Like other prostaglandin analogues, travoprost lowers IOP by enhancing the egress of aqueous humor through both the uveoscleral and trabecular outflow channels. This review summarizes the published data regarding the safety and efficacy of travoprost. Travoprost provides statistically significant and clinically relevant reductions in mean IOP, of the order of 6.5-9.0 mmHg in most studies. In addition, travoprost provides consistent diurnal IOP control, with statistically significant IOP reductions persisting up to 84 hours post-dose. Travoprost has a highly favorable safety profile; most adverse events are cosmetic in nature (such as iris hyperpigmentation and eyelash growth), although more serious adverse events (such as iritis and macular edema) have been associated with travoprost and the other prostaglandin drugs. In some markets, travoprost is available in a fixed combination with timolol; clinical studies have demonstrated that the fixed combination - dosed once daily - lowers IOP by 7-11.5 mmHg. In conclusion, travoprost provides safe and effective reduction of IOP, with convenient once-daily dosing, supporting its role as primary monotherapy.']",['eng'],,

The latter is achieved by examining liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) mass spectra of both monofunctional PEG and PEG in several cases, and matching peak retention times with those of available PEG standards for all M-PEG and V-PEG sample types. This information is helpful in selecting the appropriate PEG standard to determine PEG content in each sample type. ELSD response factors for various PEG standards have also been compared.

To elucidate its role in maintaining CO(2) assimilation rate at high temperature, we examined the temperature response of CO(2) assimilation rate at 380 microL L(-1) CO(2) concentration (A(380)) and Rubisco activation state in wild-type and transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) with reduced Rubisco activase content grown at either 20 degrees C or 30 degrees C. Analyses of gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence showed that in the wild type, A(380) was limited by ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate regeneration at lower temperatures, whereas at higher temperatures, A(380) was limited by ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylation irrespective of growth temperatures. Growth temperature induced modest differences in Rubisco activation state that declined with measuring temperature, from mean values of 76% at 15 degrees C to 63% at 40 degrees C in wild-type plants. At measuring temperatures of 25 degrees C and below, an 80% reduction in Rubisco activase content was required before Rubisco activation state was decreased. Above 35 degrees C, Rubisco activation state decreased slightly with more modest decreases in Rubisco activase content, but the extent of the reductions in Rubisco activation state were small, such that a 55% reduction in Rubisco activase content did not alter the temperature sensitivity of Rubisco activation and had no effect on in vivo catalytic turnover rates of Rubisco. There was a strong correlation between Rubisco activase content and Rubisco activation state once Rubisco activase content was less that 20% of wild type at all measuring temperatures. We conclude that reduction in Rubisco activase content does not lead to an increase in the temperature sensitivity of Rubisco activation state in tobacco.']",['eng'],"['Acclimatization/physiology', 'Carbon Dioxide/metabolism', 'Chloroplasts/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Photosynthesis/physiology', 'Plant Proteins/metabolism', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Temperature', 'Tobacco/enzymology', 'Tobacco/genetics']","['Plant Proteins', 'rca protein, plant', 'Carbon Dioxide (142M471B3J)']"

Malnutrition, especially when related to protein- and energy supply, is very common in patients with liver cirrhosis and has prognostic significance regarding mortality and complication rates. A sufficient daily energy and protein supply should be ensured, one which is higher than that for the normal population. Additional substitution of vitamins and trace elements is indicated when symptoms of deficiency became apparent.']",['ger'],"['Dietary Proteins/administration & dosage', 'Energy Intake', 'Humans', 'Liver Cirrhosis/complications', 'Liver Cirrhosis/epidemiology', 'Liver Cirrhosis/physiopathology', 'Malnutrition/diagnosis', 'Malnutrition/diet therapy', 'Malnutrition/epidemiology', 'Malnutrition/etiology', 'Malnutrition/physiopathology', 'Osteoporosis/diagnosis', 'Osteoporosis/epidemiology', 'Osteoporosis/etiology', 'Osteoporosis/physiopathology', 'Osteoporosis/therapy']",['Dietary Proteins']

The results indicated the participants experienced sleep disturbances, including multiple awakenings at night and excessive daytime napping. Those in the nursing home had significantly more interdaily stability and less intradaily variability, with higher relative amplitude in their rest-activity rhythms, indicating more stable and stronger rest-activity rhythms than those in the assisted living facility.

Level of evidence (Oxford criteria) was 2-3b. For SPECT, the highest diagnostic accuracy of 95% for diagnosis of bone and joint infections is achieved with combined (111)In-WBC and (99m)Tc-sulfur colloid. Acceptable diagnostic accuracy was also obtained with (99m)Tc-WBC or (111)In-WBC combined with (99m)Tc-methylene diphosphonate ((99m)Tc-MDP). FDG-PET is useful for diagnosis of osteomyelitis with a sensitivity and specificity generally over 95%. In patients with orthopedic implant infections, sensitivity varies widely from 28% to 91% and specificity from 9% to 97%. This variation in FDG-PET performance in orthopedic implant infections depends largely on the (use of different) criteria to diagnose infection. Determination of the best criteria is still a matter of debate.!##!Conclusions!#!SPECT/computed tomography (CT) with (111)In-WBC combined with (99m)Tc-MDP or (99m)Tc-sulfur colloid seems to be the best imaging technique for diagnosis of bone and joint infections. FDG-PET is also useful for diagnosis of osteomyelitis with improved spatial resolution over SPECT imaging, allowing more accurate localization. Localization can be further improved by adding CT. Diagnosis of orthopedic implant infections with FDG-PET depends strongly on the localization of the implant and the criteria used to diagnose infection. Confirmation of well defined criteria to diagnose infection on FDG-PET in patients with metallic implants is thus of paramount importance for optimal diagnosis.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Joint Diseases/diagnostic imaging', 'Joint Diseases/pathology', 'Joint Diseases/physiopathology', 'Osteomyelitis/complications', 'Osteomyelitis/diagnostic imaging', 'Osteomyelitis/pathology', 'Osteomyelitis/physiopathology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography/methods', 'Positron-Emission Tomography/trends', 'Prosthesis-Related Infections/diagnostic imaging', 'Prosthesis-Related Infections/pathology', 'Prosthesis-Related Infections/physiopathology', 'Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon/methods', 'Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon/trends']",

Recently, anodal slow oscillation stimulation at a frequency of 0.75 Hz has been shown to augment intrinsic slow oscillations during sleep and theta oscillations during wakefulness. To embed this new type of stimulation into the existing tDCS literature, we aimed to characterize the after effects of slowly oscillating stimulation (so-tDCS) on M1(HAND) excitability and to compare them to those of c-tDCS. Here we show that so-tDCS at 0.8 Hz can also induce lasting changes in corticospinal excitability during wakefulness. Experiment 1. In 10 healthy awake individuals, we applied c-tDCS or so-tDCS to left M1(HAND) on separate days. Each tDCS protocol lasted for 10 min. Measurements of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) confirmed previous work showing that anodal c-tDCS at an intensity of 0.75 mA (maximal current density 0.0625 mA/cm2) enhanced corticospinal excitability, while cathodal c-tDCS at 0.75 mA reduced it. The polarity-specific shifts in excitability persisted for at least 20 min after c-tDCS. Using a peak current intensity of 0.75 mA, neither anodal nor cathodal so-tDCS had consistent effects on corticospinal excitability. Experiment 2. In a separate group of ten individuals, peak current intensity of so-tDCS was raised to 1.5 mA (maximal current density 0.125 mA/cm2) to match the total amount of current applied with so-tDCS to the amount of current that had been applied with c-tDCS at 0.75 mA in Experiment 1. At peak intensity of 1.5 mA, anodal and cathodal so-tDCS produced bidirectional changes in corticospinal excitability comparable to the after effects that had been observed after c-tDCS at 0.75 mA in Experiment 1. The results show that so-tDCS can induce bidirectional shifts in corticospinal excitability in a similar fashion as c-tDCS if the total amount of applied current during the tDCS session is matched.']",['eng'],"['Action Potentials/physiology', 'Adult', 'Biological Clocks/physiology', 'Brain Mapping/methods', 'Electric Stimulation/methods', 'Electricity', 'Electronics, Medical', 'Electrophysiology', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor/physiology', 'Female', 'Hand/innervation', 'Hand/physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Motor Cortex/anatomy & histology', 'Motor Cortex/physiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity/physiology', 'Neurons/physiology', 'Pyramidal Tracts/physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation/methods', 'Wakefulness', 'Young Adult']",

The QuantiFERON-CMV assay for cellular HCMV-specific immunity was evaluated in allogeneic HSCT recipients (n = 43) and patients with hematological malignancies (n = 29) attending a tertiary-care Irish hospital. An intracellular cytokine (ICC) assay correlated with the QuantiFERON-CMV assay. Although there was agreement between HCMV seropositivity and QuantiFERON-CMV assay, six HCMV seropositive immunosuppressed patients with hematological malignancy had negative QuantiFERON-CMV results. The 43 HSCT recipients were classified as high risk (D(-)/R(+)) (n = 18), intermediate risk (D(+)/R(+) and D(+)/R(-)) (n = 17), and low risk (D(-)/R(-)) (n = 8). During episodes of HCMV DNAemia no evidence of HCMV-specific immunity was found using the QuantiFERON-CMV assay. Furthermore, the recovery of HCMV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses in high-risk seropositive recipients of matched unrelated donors was severely delayed, a mean of 200 (SD = 117) days compared to 58 (SD = 23) days for sibling donors (P < or = 0.028). In addition, three patients with late HCMV infection (infection >100 days post-transplant) had delayed reconstitution of HCMV-specific CD8(+) T cells. Interestingly, two recipients (R(+)/D(-)) developed rapid immune reconstitution by days 15 and 36 post-HSCT, suggesting HCMV-specific T-cell lymphopoiesis of recipient origin. Levels of CD8(+) T-cell immunity in HCMV seropositive HSCT recipients were lowest following HSCT. A high number (33%) of indeterminate results was observed immediately after transplantation. Patients with indeterminate QuantiFERON-CMV results had low levels of HCMV-specific CD8(+) T cells. J. Med. Virol. 82:433-440, 2010.

In recent years, different strategies have been adopted to micropropagate poinsettia, which could assist breeders to meet consumer demands. The development of reliable in vitro regeneration procedures is likely to play a crucial role in future production systems. Stem nodal explants cultured on semi-solid MS-based medium supplemented with benzylaminopurine (BAP) and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) develop shoots from adventitious/axillary buds after 7 weeks of culture. Rooting of in vitro regenerated shoots is achieved in semi-solid MS-based medium containing the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA).

The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of PEEP titration guided by ventilation homogeneity using the global inhomogeneity (GI) index based on electrical impedance tomography (EIT) images.!##!Methods!#!In a retrospective study, 10 anesthetized patients with healthy lungs mechanically ventilated under volume-controlled mode were investigated. Ventilation distribution was monitored by EIT. A standardized incremental PEEP trial (PEEP from 0 to 28 mbar, 2 mbar per step) was conducted. During the PEEP trial, ""optimal"" PEEP level for each patient was determined when the air was most homogeneously distributed in the lung, indicated by the lowest GI index value. Two published methods for setting PEEP were included for comparison based on the maximum global dynamic compliance and the intra-tidal compliance-volume curve.!##!Results!#!No significant differences in the results were observed between the GI index method (12.2 +/- 4.6 mbar) and the dynamic compliance method (11.4 +/- 2.3 mbar, P > 0.6), or between the GI index and the compliance-volume curve method (12.2 +/- 4.9 mbar, P > 0.6).!##!Conclusions!#!According to the results, it is feasible and reasonable to use the GI index to select the PEEP level with respect to ventilation homogeneity.

Yet differences in literacy measurement and the cutoffs used for analysis have made it difficult to fully understand the relationship between literacy and health across the entire spectrum of literacy (i.e., whether the relationship is continuous and graded or whether a threshold exists below which literacy is independently associated with health). To analyze this question, we re-examined the relationship between literacy, baseline physical functioning and mental health, and all-cause mortality for a cohort of 3260 US community-dwelling elderly who were interviewed in 1997 to determine demographics, socioeconomic status, chronic conditions, self-reported physical and mental health (SF-36 subscales), health behaviors, and literacy based upon the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA). All-cause mortality was determined using data from the US National Death Index through 2003. Seven categories of S-TOFHLA literacy scores were created and used in this analysis instead of the existing three categories identified with the measure. In multivariate analyses, a continuous, graded relationship between literacy and baseline physical functioning was identified. However, participants scoring below the third literacy category had significantly worse mental health compared to the highest literacy category, displaying a notable threshold. Finally, all six literacy categories were significantly associated with greater all-cause mortality risk compared to the highest literacy category, but again there was a marked threshold below the third category at which the adjusted mortality rate significantly increased compared to all other categories. We conclude that the nature of the relationship between literacy and health may vary depending upon the outcome under examination.']",['eng'],"['Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Health Literacy', 'Health Status', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Male', 'Mental Health', 'Mortality', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'United States/epidemiology']",

We performed morphometry to directly quantitate changes in bone volume and marrow adipocyte distribution in tibiae after the jump training. We also examined changes in the expression of osteogenic and adipogenic transcription factor proteins and mRNAs after the jump training. Four weeks of jump training induced an increase in trabecular bone volume, which was associated with the recruitment of runt-related transcription factor 2 expressing cells, as well as a decrease in marrow fat volume. However, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2 protein and mRNA expression levels did not change after high-impact jump training. The mRNA expression levels of the adipocyte differentiation genes CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs)alpha, C/EBPbeta, and C/EBPdelta also showed no change during the training period in jump-trained rats.

In this report, we describe the first example of functional RubisCO proteins obtained from genes cloned and characterized from metagenomic libraries derived from DNA isolated from environmental samples.

Rubisco synthesis, N influx and the mRNA levels of Rubisco-encoding genes were determined as a function of leaf position in 4.5-month-old Eucalyptus globulus seedlings. Rubisco concentration was slightly higher in the top leaves as leaf expansion progressed and was almost maximal in the uppermost fully expanded leaves. Rubisco concentration remained almost constant in the fully expanded leaves at the top and middle positions and then became slightly low at the lowest positions. Rubisco synthesis was active only in the top leaves. These results suggest that Rubisco turnover rate is low in the middle leaves, leading to the maintenance of Rubisco contents, and that Rubisco degradation primarily occurs in the lowest leaves. Changes in the RBCS and rbcL mRNA levels were roughly parallel with Rubisco synthesis, but N influx was more closely correlated with Rubisco synthesis. These results suggest that N influx rather than the transcript abundance of Rubisco-encoding genes is of primary importance in regulating the rate of Rubisco synthesis. Additionally, expression of RBCS multigene family in E. globulus leaves was discussed.']",['eng'],"['DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Eucalyptus/enzymology', 'Nitrogen/metabolism', 'Plant Leaves/enzymology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Plant/metabolism', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase/biosynthesis', 'Seedlings/enzymology']","['DNA, Complementary', 'RNA, Messenger', 'RNA, Plant', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.39)', 'Nitrogen (N762921K75)']"

Fourteen patients who were monitored with a Swan-Ganz catheter and had failed a previous T-piece trial were studied. Three SBTs were performed in random order in all patients: PSV with PEEP (PSV-PEEP), PSV without PEEP (PSV-ZEEP), and T-piece. PSV level was 7 cmH(2)O, and PEEP was 5 cmH(2)O. Inspiratory muscle effort was calculated, and hemodynamic parameters were measured using standard methods. RESULTS [MEDIAN (AND INTERQUARTILE RANGE)]: Most patients succeeded in the PSV-PEEP (11/14) and PSV-ZEEP (8/14) trials, but all failed the T-piece trial. Patient effort was significantly higher during T-piece than during PSV with or without PEEP [esophageal pressure-time product was 292 (238-512), 128 (58-299), and 148 (100-465) cmH(2)O x s/min, respectively, p < 0.05]. Left ventricular heart failure was observed in 11 of the 14 patients during the T-piece trial. Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and respiratory rate were significantly higher during T-piece than with PSV-PEEP [21 (18-24) mmHg versus 17 (14-22) mmHg, p < 0.05 and 27 (21-35) breaths/min versus 19 (16-29) breaths/min, p < 0.05 respectively]. Tidal volume was significantly lower during the T-piece trial.!##!Conclusion!#!In this selected population of difficult-to-wean patients, PSV and PSV plus PEEP markedly modified the breathing pattern, inspiratory muscle effort, and cardiovascular response as compared to the T-piece. Caregivers should be aware of these differences in SBT as they may play an important role in weaning decision-making.']",['eng'],"['Aged', 'Cardiac Output/physiology', 'Catheterization, Swan-Ganz', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/instrumentation', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/methods', 'Positive-Pressure Respiration/instrumentation', 'Positive-Pressure Respiration/methods', 'Prospective Studies', 'Respiratory Mechanics/physiology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ventilator Weaning/instrumentation', 'Ventilator Weaning/methods']",

In the same fashion, acute osteoporotic fractures with considerable backpain can be treated with an adequate orthosis besides analgetics and osteological drugs. Essential is the careful selection of the right brace for a given type of osteoporotic fracture: Overall brace-frames (Stagnara type) should be used only in highly unstable or multiple osteoporotic fractures with impact onto the spinal canal where surgery is not possible. These brace frames should be administered only for the shortest possible period (8-12 weeks) to reduce muscle atrophy and immobilization. However, in the typical stable osteoporotic wedge fracture, light weight constructions like the Jewett or Bähler-Vogt brace or - in less severe cases - dynamic braces (e.g. TorsoStretch brace or SpinoMedActive brace) should be used to minimize muscle atrophy and demineralisation. Brace treatment at its best though, can be only one step in the cascade of measures to fight demineralisation and the clinical consequences: General physiotherapy, analgetics and specific osteological drugs and minerals add essentially to the treatment.']",['ger'],"['Aged', 'Back Pain/rehabilitation', 'Braces', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Equipment Design', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Female', 'Fractures, Spontaneous/diagnosis', 'Fractures, Spontaneous/rehabilitation', 'Humans', 'Kyphosis/diagnosis', 'Kyphosis/rehabilitation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Osteoporosis/complications', 'Osteoporosis/diagnosis', 'Osteoporosis/rehabilitation', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Spinal Fractures/diagnosis', 'Spinal Fractures/rehabilitation']",

However, in some patients the CRP values remain slightly elevated despite adequate treatment.!##!Method!#!We observed 14 patients with prosthetic joint infection (6 knee, 9 hip infections), in whom the CRP values never fell below the upper limit of normal. Eleven patients were surgically treated with débridement and retention of the prosthesis, in one patient one-staged reimplantation and in two patients two-staged reimplantations were performed.
