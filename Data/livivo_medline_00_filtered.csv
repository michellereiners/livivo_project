We previously reported on the role of microRNA (miR)-145 as a tumor-suppressor in human bladder cancer (BC) cells. In this study, we reveal that miR-145 decreases the Warburg effect by silencing KLF4 in BC cells. The expression levels of miR-145 were significantly lower in clinical BC samples and BC cell lines compared to those in normal tissues and HUC cells. Luciferase assay results showed that miR-145 directly bound to 3'UTR of KLF4, which was shown to be overexpressed in the clinical BC samples using Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Remarkable growth inhibition and apoptosis were induced by the ectopic expression of miR-145 or by the gene silencing of KLF4 (siR-KLF4). Also, Warburg effect-related genes such as PTBP1/PKMs were regulated by the transfection of BC cells with miR-145 or siR-KLF4. These results thus indicate that the miR-145/KLF4/PTBP1/PKMs axis is one of the critical pathways that maintain the Warburg effect in BC carcinogenesis. MiR-145 perturbed the Warburg effect by suppressing the KLF4/PTBP1/PKMs pathway in BC cells, resulting in significant cell growth inhibition.""]",['eng'],,

The present study is about 1) replicating the extent to which social-psychological determinants found in earlier cross-sectional studies explain HPV-vaccination intention, and 2) testing whether HPV-vaccination intention, as well as other social-psychological determinants, are good predictors of future HPV-vaccination uptake in a longitudinal design.!##!Methods!#!A random sample of mothers of girls invited for the vaccination in 2015 was drawn from the Dutch vaccination register (Praeventis) (N=36,000) and from three online panels (N=2483). Two months prior to the vaccination of girls, their mothers were requested to complete a web-based questionnaire by letter (Praeventis sample) or by e-mail (panel samples). HPV-vaccination uptake was derived from Praeventis. Backward linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine most dominant predictors of HPV-vaccination intention and uptake, respectively. The total sample used for data analyses consisted of 8062 mothers. Response rates were 18% for the Praeventis sample and 47% for the panel samples.!##!Results!#!HPV-vaccination intention was best explained by attitude, beliefs, subjective norms, habit, and perceived relative effectiveness of the vaccination; they explained 83% of the variance in HPV-vaccination intention. Intention appeared to be the only stable predictor of HPV-vaccination uptake and explained 43% of the variance in HPV-vaccination uptake.!##!Conclusions!#!These results confirm what was found by earlier cross-sectional studies, and provide strong leads for selecting relevant targets in the planning of future communication strategies aiming to improve HPV-vaccination uptake.']",['eng'],,

Despite AAP recommendations to avoid bedsharing, public health efforts have been unsuccessful in changing behaviors. African-American infants are more than twice as likely to die from SIDS and other sleep-related deaths, and are also twice as likely to bedshare with their parents. Further, African-American parents have a high degree of self-efficacy with regards to preventing infant suffocation, but low self-efficacy with regards to SIDS risk reduction. It is unclear whether messages emphasizing suffocation prevention will decrease bedsharing. To evaluate the impact of specific health messages on African-American parental decisions regarding infant sleep location. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of African-American mothers of infants. The control group received standard messaging emphasizing AAP-recommended safe sleep practices, including avoidance of bedsharing, for the purposes of SIDS risk reduction. The intervention group received enhanced messaging emphasizing safe sleep practices, including avoidance of bedsharing, for both SIDS risk reduction and suffocation prevention. Participants completed interviews at 2-3\xa0weeks, 2-3\xa0months, and 5-6\xa0months after the infant's birth. 1194 mothers were enrolled in the study, and 637 completed all interviews.

The questionnaire included questions regarding skill lab use and its benefits to them in developing their skills, with a few questions related to the exam pattern. The responses were expressed in frequencies.!##!Results!#!We found that all (20/20) students performed CPR with confidence and without hesitation on the manikin. The practical examination performance (marks) was categorized as excellent (7/20), good (8/20), average (3/20), and poor (2/20). The pass percentage after skill training was increased by 25% as compared with conventional teaching practice. The majority of the students (17/20) mentioned that skill is better learned by doing than by observing others\' performance or watching videos. A few students (6/20) said skills are better learned by observing the real disease state. They mentioned that skill lab is the better choice for learning major skills such as catheterization, opening vein, auscultation of heart sounds, and endotracheal intubation.!##!Conclusion!#!Students are confident and showed better exam performance after basic clinical skills training in the lab.

This is a retrospective comparative study of patients presented with vaginal mesh exposure between January 2001 and July 2012. This study compares patients who had undergone vaginally placed mesh procedures to those who had had abdominally placed mesh. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to measure the time to mesh exposure. There were 68 patients with mesh exposure in our cohort. Thirty eight patients had undergone vaginal placement of mesh and 30 patients had abdominal mesh. There was a statistically significant difference in time to mesh exposure between abdominal and vaginal meshes (p≤.0001). Mean time to vaginal mesh exposure with abdominal mesh was 59.8 months (95%CI 46.2-73.3) compared to 23 months (95%CI 15.9-30.2) for vaginal mesh. When controlling for age, BMI and surgeon at index surgery, the Hazard Ratio for mesh exposure in our Cox Regression model was 0.53 (95%CI 0.39-0.71) (p\u2009≤.0001). The mean time to vaginal mesh exposure after abdominal mesh was longer compared to the time to exposure with vaginally placed mesh (60 versus 23 months, p\u2009≤.0001). These results support the evolving evidence that mesh exposures can occur many years distant from the procedure and warrant some level of surveillance or provision of warning signs by the providers who perform procedures with mesh.']",['eng'],"['Abdomen/surgery', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Pelvic Floor Disorders/surgery', 'Pelvic Organ Prolapse/surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Suburethral Slings/adverse effects', 'Surgical Mesh/adverse effects', 'Urinary Incontinence/surgery', 'Vagina/surgery']",

The example of breast screening.'],"['""Nudge, or nudging, refers to a policy approach inspired by behavioral sciences: it promotes the conducts identified as desirable by regulators without applying prohibition and coercion. This approach has gained a lot of momentum in the domain of health policies. Policy strategies based on behavioral insights appear ideal as to implementing healthier life styles and public health programs while minimizing compliance costs: from organ donation to food choices, from fighting obesity and chronic diseases to screening policies. Nudging, however, is not exempt from problems, especially in the sector of health, where individual free and informed consent constitutes a founding principle. Cancer screening programs, and especially breast cancer population tests, represent an interesting example for nudging strategies which have been widely applied but have also raised serious criticisms. Despite having been widely adopted by health systems, from the United States to the European Union, breast cancer screening programs keep raising debates about their actual impact on reducing mortality, risks of overdiagnosing and unnecessary or harmful treatments. In challenging the validity of screening programs, these controversies also affect their efficacy. Nudging has therefore been seen as a potentially useful tool in increasing participation, even though the extent of its actual impact remains ambiguous and problematic. For nudging to represent a relevant, powerful policy instrument its legitimacy requirements need to be identified. These concern the ""right place"" of behavioral-based measures within the traditional regulatory framework. The ""right place"" of nudging in science-based policies is part of a broader rethinking of what is democracy in ""knowledge-based societies"", namely through which procedures democratic institutions validate and legitimize their normative choices depending on uncertain and controversial knowledge.""']",['ita'],,

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of maths anxiety on healthcare students' ability to accurately calculate drug dosages by performing a scoping review of the existing literature. This review utilised a six-stage methodology using the following databases; CINAHL, Embase, Medline, Scopus, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, Trip database (http://www.tripdatabase.com/) and Grey Literature report (http://www.greylit.org/). After an initial title/abstract review of relevant papers, and then full text review of the remaining papers, six articles were selected for inclusion in this study. Of the six articles included, there were three experimental studies, two quantitative studies and one mixed method study. All studies addressed nursing students and the presence of maths anxiety. No relevant studies from other disciplines were identified in the existing literature. Three studies took place in the U.S, the remainder in Canada, Australia and United Kingdom. Upon analysis of these studies, four factors including maths anxiety were identified as having an influence on a student's drug dosage calculation abilities. Ultimately, the results from this review suggest more research is required in nursing and other relevant healthcare disciplines regarding the effects of maths anxiety on drug dosage calculations. This additional knowledge will be important to further inform development of strategies to decrease the potentially serious effects of errors in drug dosage calculation to patient safety.

The apparent Km values were 0.125 microM for the 1-hydroxylase and 2.1 microM for the 24-hydroxylase. Exogenous 1,25(OH)2D3 decreased 1-hydroxylase and increased 24-hydroxylase within 4 h. 24,25(OH)2D3 produced similar effects, but only in the absence of fetal calf serum. R and S isomers of 1,24,25(OH)3D3 were about fives times less active than 1,25(OH)2D3. Bovine parathyroid hormone stimulated the 1- and reduced the 24-hydroxylase in 6 h, but this only occurred in cultures either previously treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 and EGTA to lower Ca to 0.8 mM or in cultures grown in the presence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3). Under the latter condition, the sensitivity to bovine parathyroid hormone was enhanced, 0.04 U/ml producing a maximum response. Synthetic aminoterminal tetratriacontapeptide (1-34) human parathyroid hormone was equally effective. In the absence of D metabolites, estradiol for 6 h produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the 1-hydroxylase, but no change in the 24-hydroxylase. Progesterone, testosterone, and corticosterone had no significant effect. In cultures grown in the presence of 25(OH)D3 no reproducible effects were obtained with either 1 microM estradiol or 1 microM testosterone, alone or in combination, but 5 microM corticosterone decreased the 1- and increased the 24-hydroxylase. Changes in Ca and P concentrations of the medium as well as addition of ethane-l-hydroxy-1, 1-diphosphate for 48 h did not affect any of the hydroxylase activities. The modulation of the hydroxylase activities by vitamin D3 metabolites and parathyroid hormone suggests that these factors regulate the renal hydroxylase by direct actions, whereas it would appear that ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-diphosphate, Ca, P, and steroid may exert their influence indirectly.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chickens', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dihydroxycholecalciferols/metabolism', 'Etidronic Acid/pharmacology', 'Hormones/pharmacology', 'Hydroxycholecalciferols/metabolism', 'Kidney/drug effects', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Parathyroid Hormone/pharmacology', 'Phosphorus/pharmacology', 'Steroid Hydroxylases/metabolism', 'Steroids/pharmacology']","['Dihydroxycholecalciferols', 'Hormones', 'Hydroxycholecalciferols', 'Parathyroid Hormone', 'Steroids', 'Phosphorus (27YLU75U4W)', 'Steroid Hydroxylases (EC 1.14.-)', 'Etidronic Acid (M2F465ROXU)', 'Calcium (SY7Q814VUP)']"

(1976). In the following experiment, to pursue the findings further, ursodesoxycholic acid was used curatively for alloxan diabetes. A first group of animals (5 mice) were injected with alloxan (4 mg) twice at the fifth and tenth day. The second group (5 mice) was injected with ursodesoxycholic acid (0.2 mg each) for 14 days during the experiment in addition to the same alloxan dosage/frequency as the first group. A third group of animals (5 mice) served as the control. The animals were sacrificed on the 15th day and the blood sugar levels were examined, using commercial test paper. The pancreatic tissues were fixed in a mixture of 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% osmid acid solution, which was adjusted at pH 7.4 with a veronal acetate buffer; the osmotic pressure was also regulated by adding sucrose of 0.045 g/ml. Following dehydration using a series of alcohol concentrations, the tissues were embedded in Epon 812. Thin sections were cut with a Porter-Blum MT-2B ultramicrotome, stained with both uranyl acetate and a lead mixture, and then observed by electron microscopy. The results were as follows: The pancreatic islet cells, especially of B-cells in the first group of animals injected with alloxan only, were seriously damaged and contained myelinated mitochondria. Golgi apparatus, and an increasing number of autophagic vacuoles. Some B-cells revealed hydropic degeneration. Some B-granules changed into vacuoles after diacrine secretion. Pancreatic A-cells were increased in number and showed no cell injuries. On the other hand, the pancreatic B-cells of mice treated with both alloxan and ursodesoxycholic acid maintained almost normal fine structures. In summary, ursodesoxycholic acid has a curative effect on alloxan-induced pancreatic B-cell injury.']",['jpn'],"['Animals', 'Blood Glucose/analysis', 'Deoxycholic Acid/therapeutic use', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/pathology', 'Golgi Apparatus/ultrastructure', 'Islets of Langerhans/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/ultrastructure']","['Blood Glucose', 'Deoxycholic Acid (005990WHZZ)']"

Four of the five showed a significant improvement in PaO2, a decrease in AaDO2 and Qs/Qt, the fifth a slight improvement on PEEP. Arterial washouts were significantly faster on  PEEP in all patients suggesting a decrease in intrapulmonary shunting. Airway washouts in the initial phase were faster off PEEP suggesting an increase in lung volume and FRC with PEEP.

It was found that neurofibrillary degeneration is present at an earlier age than has been reported for a comparable population in Japan, and much earlier than reported for two similarly comparable English populations. Our data suggests that neurofibrillary degeneration is the common denominator of the Guam neurological syndromes of parkinsonian dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and dementia without parkinsonism. This conclusion would imply that the aetiological factor of neurofibrillary degeneration is more widely dispersed in the population than suggested by the cases of parkinsonian dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis alone. Both sexes were equally affected while clinical parkinsonian dementia is three times more frequent among males. The sample data suggests a positive association with the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-parkinsonian dementia rate in village of birth and residence, and also with family history; the results in the small subsamples are not significant. Senile plaques were found in few control cases in this study, just as there has been a relative absence of senile plaques in cases of parkinsonian dementia. In a small group of Caucasians who had spent many of their adult years on Guam, the frequency of neurofibrillary degeneration in relationship to age was comparable to that in the English populations.']",['eng'],"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alzheimer Disease/epidemiology', 'Alzheimer Disease/pathology', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/pathology', 'Asian Continental Ancestry Group', 'Brain Diseases/epidemiology', 'Brain Diseases/pathology', 'Cerebral Cortex/pathology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Guam', 'Hippocampus/pathology', 'Humans', 'Locus Coeruleus/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neurofibrils/pathology', 'Organ Size', 'Parkinson Disease/pathology', 'Substantia Nigra/pathology']",

Doses of 25(OH)D3 were 20, 100, 500, or 1000 microgram/day given orally for 7--10 days. There was an increase in 47Ca absorption and urinary calcium in normal subjects receiving 20 microgram/day, while doses of 500 or 1000 microgram/day were required to augment 47Ca absorption in renal failure patients. During treatment, plasma levels of 25(OH)D increased to similar levels in both normal and uremic subjects. A comparison of the dose-response curves found 25(OH)D3 to be 1/125 as potent as 1,25-(OH)2D3 in the normal subjects and 1/400 as potent as 1,25(OH)2D3 in patients with chronic renal failure. Thus, pharmacologic doses of 25(OH)D3 are active in both normal and uremic patients, although relatively greater quantities are necessary in uremia. This difference in relative potency of 1,25(OH)2D3 and 25(OH)D3 may be explained by some conversion of 25(OH)D3 to 1,25(OH)2D3 in normal compared to uremic subjects, while 25(OH)D3 may act in large part via mass action in uremic patients.']",['eng'],"['Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium/urine', 'Dihydroxycholecalciferols/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Hydroxycholecalciferols/pharmacology', 'Intestinal Absorption/drug effects', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Uremia/metabolism']","['Dihydroxycholecalciferols', 'Hydroxycholecalciferols', 'Calcium (SY7Q814VUP)']"

Test materials were injected into the cranial thyroid artery of the dog, and immunoreactive PTH was measured frequently in serum samples from the inferior thyroid vein and the femoral vein. This model for the study of secretion had previously been validated with the use of known modulators on PTH secretion. In control experiments, injection of 100% ethanol, the vehicle in which cholecalciferol (D(3)) metabolites were suspended, resulted in no change in PTH secretion. Likewise, native vitamin D(3), in doses ranging from 250 to 1,250 ng had no effect on PTH secretion. 25-Hydroxycholecalciferol, 25-(OH)D(3), in doses of 125-240 ng, caused complete suppression of PTH secretion. When 24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, 24,25-(OH)(2)D(3), was injected in doses of 50-250 ng, suppression of PTH secretion was again complete; in doses of 5 ng, injection of this metabolite resulted in significant but incomplete suppression of secretion. In doses of 50-250 ng, 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) strongly stimulated PTH secretion, but in a dose of 5 ng this metabolite had no effects. Injection of equal doses of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) and 24,25-(OH)(2)D(3) resulted in significant suppression of PTH secretion. Hypocalcemia-induced stimulation of PTH secretion was suppressed by 24,25-(OH)(2)D(3) while hypercalcemia-induced suppression of PTH secretion was stimulated by 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3). In all experiments showing suppression of PTH secretion, peripheral PTH decreased. Arguments are presented for considering the suppressive effects of D(3) metabolites as physiologic modulators. However, this stimulating effect of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) occurred only in pharmacologic doses and hence probably has no physiologic relevance.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Dihydroxycholecalciferols/pharmacology', 'Dogs', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Hydroxycholecalciferols/pharmacology', 'Hypercalcemia/metabolism', 'Hypocalcemia/metabolism', 'Male', 'Parathyroid Hormone/secretion', 'Secretory Rate/drug effects']","['Dihydroxycholecalciferols', 'Hydroxycholecalciferols', 'Parathyroid Hormone']"

Both 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OHD(3)) at a concentration of 20 ng/ml or greater and 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)] at a concentration of 50 pg/ml or greater stimulated the rate of accumulation of [(32)P]phosphate and (45)Ca by the explants and the incorporation of [(3)H]thymidine into DNA. The accumulation of [(32)P]phosphate by the explants was against a concentration gradient and inhibited by ouabain and dinitrophenol. Two saturable mechanisms appeared to mediate the cellular accumulation of phosphate with K(a) of 0.0047 and 0.125 mM, respectively. The V(max) of the lower affinity transport mechanism was accelerated by 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3). Actinomycin D (5.0 mug/ml) did not block the intestinal response to 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) stimulation of both [(32)p]phosphate and (45)Ca accumulation. Significant stimulation of [(32)P]phosphate accumulation was observed 30 min after the addition of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3), preceding the sterol-induced increase in the rate of (45)Ca uptake by 30 min and the sterol-induced increase in [(3)H]thymidine incorporation into DNA by 150 min. Increasing extracellular phosphate concentration to 3.0 mM increased [(3)H]thymidine incorporation into DNA and the rate of (45)Ca uptake by the explants. Reducing extracellular phosphate concentration to 0.05 mM attenuated the response of the explants to 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3). From these observations it is postulated that the primary action of vitamin D sterols in the intestine is to enhance the ability of the mucosal cell to accumulate phosphate. The data suggest that restoration of intracellular phosphate levels may then permit expression of the cells' response to vitamin D sterols.""]",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Chickens', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dihydroxycholecalciferols/pharmacology', 'Dinitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Hydroxycholecalciferols/pharmacology', 'Intestinal Mucosa/drug effects', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism', 'Intestines/drug effects', 'Intestines/metabolism', 'Iodoacetamide/pharmacology', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Ouabain/pharmacology', 'Phosphates/metabolism', 'Phosphates/pharmacology', 'Phosphates/physiology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Vitamin D/pharmacology', 'Vitamin D Deficiency/metabolism', 'Vitamin D Deficiency/physiopathology']","['Dihydroxycholecalciferols', 'Dinitrophenols', 'Hydroxycholecalciferols', 'Phosphates', 'Vitamin D (1406-16-2)', 'Dactinomycin (1CC1JFE158)', 'Ouabain (5ACL011P69)', 'DNA (9007-49-2)', 'Cycloheximide (98600C0908)', 'Thymidine (VC2W18DGKR)', 'Iodoacetamide (ZRH8M27S79)']"

The Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale was used to measure health locus of control. An educational, low-fear intervention, consisting of the presentation of a pictorial diagram of the progression of periodontal disease and discussion of the importance of flossing was presented to the experimental subjects before monitoring began. Control subjects underwent a brief dental examination and flossing instruction only. Self-reported flossing compliance was monitored for 24 days following the dental examination and intervention. Significant decreases in the dental exam variables associated with plaque were found for both the experimental and control conditions. The low-fear, educational intervention had no significant impact on compliance. Instead, a dental exam and self-monitoring were as effective at increasing flossing compliance as the more time-consuming educational approach. A significant increase in internality of health locus of control across all subjects was also found. No significant interaction was found between health locus of control and group, but a trend was apparent. Control subjects who were externally oriented had the lowest flossing compliance scores while internal subjects in both conditions had higher flossing compliance scores.']",['eng'],"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Dental Devices, Home Care/utilization', 'Dental Plaque/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Internal-External Control', 'Male', 'Oral Hygiene/methods', 'Patient Compliance']",

To investigate the interactions of ubiquinone with the cyt bc1 complex, we have examined the distinctive EPR line shapes of the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the cyt bc1 complex when the Qpool-cyt bc1 complex interactions are modulated by changing the numbers of Q or QH2 present (by solvent extraction and reconstitution), by the exposure of the [2Fe-2S] to the Qpool in different redox states, by the presence of inhibitors specific for the Qo site (myxothiazol and stigmatellin) and Qi site (antimycin), and by site-specific mutations of side chains of the cyt b polypeptide (mutants F144L and F144G) previously identified as important for Qo site structure. Evidence suggests that the Qo site can accommodate two ubiquinone molecules. One (designated Qos) is bound relatively strongly and is second only to the ubiquinone of the QA site of the reaction center in its resistance to solvent extraction. In this strong interaction, the Qo site binds Q and QH2 with approximately equal affinities. Their bound states are distinguished by their effects on the [2Fe-2S] cluster spectral feature at gx at 1.783 (Q) and gx at 1.777 (QH2); titration of the line-shape change reveals an Em7 value of approximately 95 mV. The other molecule (Qow) is bound more weakly, in the same range as the ubiquinone of the QB site of the reaction center. Again, the affinities of the Q form (gx at 1.800) and QH2 form (gx at 1.777) are nearly equal, and the Em7 value measured is approximately 80 mV. These results are discussed in terms of earlier EPR analyses of the cyt bc1 complexes of other systems. A Qo site double-occupancy model is considered that builds on the previous model based on Qo site mutants [Robertson, D. E., Daldal, F.,& Dutton, P. L. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 11249-11260] and includes the recent suggestion that two of the [2F3-2S] cluster ligands of the R. capsulatus cyt bc1 complex are histidines [Gurbiel, R. J. Ohnishi, T., Robertson, D. E. Daldal, F., & Hoffman, B. M. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 11579-11584].

Rearrangements principally affect some constitutive heterochromatin and, to a lesser degree, telomeric regions. This results in multiple exchanges between a limited number of chromosome structures, i.e., in jumping translocations. Such rearrangements occur even at early passages and some of them give rise to clonal rearrangements that accumulate at late passages. This process is responsible for progressive modification of the karyotypes, principally characterized by deletion of a number of chromosome segments. Thus, clonal rearrangements are selected among many others not occurring at random. The selective pressure retaining clonal rearrangement seems to be similar for the 4 independent clones, since selection of the derivative chromosomes leads to the same imbalances, whatever the origin of the clone. This sequence of events recalls that of human solid tumors, since jumping rearrangements are generally observed in pre-malignant conditions or in low-grade malignancies, whereas clonal rearrangements leading to typical imbalances are detected in more advanced malignant tumors.']",['eng'],"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Simian virus 40/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",

In the presence of PEG, Rubisco activase exhibited higher ATPase and Rubisco activating activities, concomitant with increased apparent affinity for ATP and Rubisco. Specific ATPase activity, which was dependent on Rubisco activase concentration, was also higher in the presence of Ficoll, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and bovine serum albumin. The ability of Rubisco activase to facilitate dissociation of the tight-binding inhibitor 2-carboxyarabinitol 1-phosphate from carbamylated Rubisco was also enhanced in the presence of PEG. Mixing experiments with Rubisco activase from two different sources showed that tobacco Rubisco activase, which exhibited little activation of spinach Rubisco by itself, was inhibitory when included with spinach Rubisco activase. Polyethylene glycol improved the ability of tobacco and a mixture of tobacco plus spinach Rubisco activase to activate spinach Rubisco. Estimates based on rate zonal sedimentation and gel-filtration chromatography indicated that the apparent molecular mass of Rubisco activase was two- to fourfold higher in the presence of PEG. The increase in apparent molecular mass was consistent with the propensity of solvent-excluding reagents like PEG to promote self-association of proteins. Likewise, the change in enzymatic properties of Rubisco activase in the presence of PEG and the dependence of specific activity on protein concentration resembled changes that often accompany self-association. For Rubisco activase, high concentrations of protein in the chloroplast stroma would provide an environment conducive to self-association and cause expression of properties that would enhance its ability to function efficiently in vivo.']",['eng'],"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Kinetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Weight', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plants/enzymology', 'Plants, Toxic', 'Polyethylene Glycols/pharmacology', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase/isolation & purification', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase/metabolism', 'Species Specificity', 'Tobacco/enzymology']","['Macromolecular Substances', 'Plant Proteins', 'rca protein, plant', 'Polyethylene Glycols (3WJQ0SDW1A)', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases (EC 3.6.1.-)', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.39)']"

The ratio of 19- to 11-hydroxylation was invariant with changes in concentration of substrate or a competitive inhibitor. It is most likely, therefore, that a single 11,19-hydroxylase catalyzes both oxidations. Both primary products are further oxidized to the corresponding carbonyl analogs, 19-oxo-DOC and 11-dehydrocorticosterone, at rates that are approx. 20% of their rates of formation. The oxidation of 11-dehydrocorticosterone is catalyzed by a dehydrogenase utilizing either NAD or NADP while the oxidation of 19-hydroxy-DOC is catalyzed by an oxidase requiring NADPH. The 11-dehydrocorticosterone is stable in this enzyme preparation while 19-oxo-DOC is metabolized to two additional products, which are tentatively identified as 19-oic-DOC and 19-norcorticosterone. 19-nor-DOC was found to be hydroxylated at a rate that is 20% faster than the rate for DOC under the same conditions. It is therefore possible that 19-norcorticosterone can arise from 19-oic-DOC via decarboxylation to 19-nor-DOC and subsequent 11-hydroxylation, but the kinetics of its formation suggest that it may actually be formed directly from 19-oxo-DOC without free intermediates. 4-Androstene-3,17-dione and 17-hydroxy-DOC were also substrates for this 11,19-hydroxylase, but 18-hydroxy-DOC was not.

Recent work suggests that a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent 11 beta-OHSD isoform is expressed in distal renal tubule, in contrast with the hepatic isoform which is NAD(+)-phosphate (NADP+)-dependent. To establish the distribution of the NAD(+)-dependent isoform we measured in vitro conversion of [3H]corticosterone to [3H]11-dehydrocorticosterone in homogenized rat tissues in the presence of NADP+ or NAD+. In most tissues (liver, testis, hippocampus, heart, aorta, mesenteric artery) NADP+ increased activity and NAD+ was without effect. However, in whole renal cortex, colon, placenta, and lung both NADP+ and NAD+ increased activity. No difference in cofactor utilization was demonstrated between proximal and distal renal tubules following density gradient separation. This distribution of NAD(+)-dependent activity corresponds with: (i) the distribution of multiple mRNA and/or protein species of 11 beta-OHSD; (ii) the distribution of aldosterone-specific mineralocorticoid receptors; and (iii) the equilibrium between active and inactive glucocorticoids in each tissue. We suggest that the tissue-specific expression of isoforms of 11 beta-OHSD with different kinetic properties confers on them diverse roles in modulating corticosteroid receptor activation.']",['eng'],"['11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases', 'Animals', 'Colon/enzymology', 'Corticosterone/analogs & derivatives', 'Corticosterone/metabolism', 'Female', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/analysis', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/metabolism', 'Kidney Cortex/enzymology', 'Lung/enzymology', 'NAD/pharmacology', 'NADP/pharmacology', 'Placenta/enzymology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Tissue Distribution']","['NAD (0U46U6E8UK)', 'NADP (53-59-8)', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.-)', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.146)', '11-dehydrocorticosterone (FO4V44A3G3)', 'Corticosterone (W980KJ009P)']"

This could suggest a rising incidence of the disease but is probably largely related to the recently acquired ability to demonstrate minimal and mild lesions. However, estimates of the distribution of endometriosis in the female population might be unreliable due to lack of control of the variables which influence diagnosis of the disease in the initial stages. Analysis of data from prospective studies on asymptomatic women undergoing tubal sterilization reveals a markedly higher than expected frequency of endometriosis. This raises doubts on the clinical significance of the minimal lesions that are often found. The concept that initial endometriosis should always be treated to avoid worsening of the condition seems to lack a convincing rational basis and is not supported by definitive scientific evidence. Minimal/mild endometriosis could represent a temporary phase in an on-going process that usually results in cytolysis of recently implanted endometrial cells, whereas in a few immunologically 'tolerant' subjects, nodular, cystic and infiltrating lesions develop, with eventual progression to moderate and severe stages.""]",['eng'],"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Endometriosis/diagnosis', 'Endometriosis/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies']",

M1660429,['Direct cloning of a long restriction fragment aided with a jumping clone.'],"[""Long-range physical mapping with rare-cutting restriction enzymes (rare cutters) is an important step for structural analysis of complex genomes. Combination of two types of DNA clones bearing the rare-cutter sites, linking clones and jumping clones (Fig. 1a), facilitates the physical mapping [Poustka et al., Nature 325 (1987) 353-355]. A step followed by the physical mapping is the cloning of the large (rare-cutter-generated) restriction fragment of interest. For facilitating this step, we devised a method to directly clone a long restriction fragment without constructing the whole genomic DNA library using the jumping clone as starting material. The short DNA segments of a jumping clone, which are derived from the 5' and 3' terminal regions of the large restriction fragment, are inserted into the yeast artificial chromosome plasmid (pYAC) vector, and then converted into single strands with T7 gene 6-encoded 5'----3' exonuclease. The total genomic DNA digested with the restriction enzyme is also treated with the exonuclease to convert the terminal regions of the restriction fragments into single strands. In the resulting products, only the fragment corresponding to the jumping clone can form hybrids with the just-mentioned, single-stranded DNAs, which are connected to the pYAC, and only this fragment is cloned in yeast.

The larger the proportion of native (or near-native) speakers included in a set of sentences being evaluated, the more strongly accented listeners judged sentences spoken by non-native speakers to be. Foreign accent ratings were not stable. Listeners judged a set of non-native-produced sentences to be more strongly accented after, as compared to before, they became familiar with those sentences. One talker-related effect noted in the study was the finding that adults' pronunciation of an L2 may improve over time. Late L2 learners who had lived in the United States for an average of 14.3 years received significantly higher scores than late learners who had resided in the United States for 0.7 years. Another talker-related effect pertained to the age of L2 learning (AOL). Native Spanish subjects with an AOL of five to six years were not found to have an accent (i.e., to receive significantly lower scores than native English speakers), whereas native Chinese subjects with an average AOL of 7.6 years did have a measurable accent.

M1783374,['New strategy for mapping the human genome based on a novel procedure for construction of jumping libraries.'],"['A novel procedure for construction of jumping libraries is described. The essential features of this procedure are as follows: (1) two diphasmid vectors (lambda SK17 and lambda SK22) are simultaneously used in the library construction to improve representativity, (2) a partial filling-in reaction is used to eliminate cloning of artifactual jumping clones and to obviate the need for a selectable marker. The procedure has been used to construct a representative human NotI jumping library (220,000 independent recombinant clones) from the lymphoblastoid cell line CBMI-Ral-STO, which features a low level of methylation of its resident EBV genomes. A human chromosome 3-specific NotI jumping library (500,000 independent recombinant clones) from the human chromosome 3 x mouse hybrid cell line MCH 903.1 has also been constructed. Of these recombinant clones 50-80% represent jumps to the neighboring cleavable NotI site. With our previously published method for construction of linking libraries this procedure makes a new genome mapping strategy feasible. This strategy includes the determination of tagging sequences adjacent to NotI sites in random linking and jumping clones. Special features of the lambda SK17 and lambda SK22 vectors facilitate such sequencing. The STS (sequence tagged site) information obtained can be assembled by computer into a map representing the linear order of the NotI sites for a chromosome or for the entire genome. The computerized mapping data can be used to retrieve clones near a region of interest. The corresponding clones can be obtained from the panel of original clones, or necessary probes can be made from genomic DNA by PCR.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping/methods', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Gene Library', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']","['Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific (EC 3.1.21.4)', 'GCGGCCGC-specific type II deoxyribonucleases (EC 3.1.21.4)']"

We prospectively determined the minimum effective dose of bedtime UDCA in 44 patients with radiolucent gallstones treated with a range of UDCA doses (4.6-17.0 mg/kg/day). The average minimum effective dose for reducing the cholesterol saturation index (SI) of gallbladder bile to a value of 0.8 was 8.4 mg/kg/day for bedtime UDCA. The greater potency of the bedtime regimen was confirmed in seven individual patients by comparison with a mealtime regimen. Cholesterol SI was reduced from 1.25 during placebo to 0.73 during 7 mg/kg/day for bedtime UDCA and to 0.81 during 10 mg/kg/day for mealtime UDCA. The effect of the bedtime regimen was not enhanced by a repeated-release tablet formulation of UDCA by comparison with UDCA in 15 patients. We conclude that the bile acid dose is reduced during bedtime UDCA administration by comparison with mealtime UDCA in individual patients and that the best-buy regimen is 8.4 mg/kg/day UDCA given at bedtime for patients with gallstones as a group. With this dose, gallstone dissolution can be supported by unsaturated gallbladder bile at minimum risk of dose-related side effects and at minimum treatment costs.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bile/chemistry', 'Cholelithiasis/drug therapy', 'Cholelithiasis/economics', 'Cholesterol/analysis', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Time Factors', 'Ursodeoxycholic Acid/administration & dosage', 'Ursodeoxycholic Acid/therapeutic use']","['Ursodeoxycholic Acid (724L30Y2QR)', 'Cholesterol (97C5T2UQ7J)']"

We have previously demonstrated that cortisol-induced cutaneous vasoconstriction in man is potentiated by the 11 beta-OHSD inhibitor glycyrrhetinic acid, suggesting that 11 beta-OHSD may protect vascular corticosteroid receptors. In this study we report quantitation of 11 beta-OHSD bioactivity in homogenates of rat aorta, mesenteric artery, caudal artery, and heart, expressed as the percent in vitro conversion of 3H-corticosterone to 3H-11-dehydrocorticosterone.

Reduction of 3H-11-dehydrocorticosterone to 3H-corticosterone was not detected in these experiments.

Evidence for a 'catalytic switch' at the Qo center.""]","[""The binding characteristics of inhibitors of the mitochondrial cytochrome c reductase were studied by fluorescence quench titration. Based on the standard binding equation, the applied numerical method allowed the online recorded titration curves to be interpreted by fitting the Kd, the number of binding sites, and the specific fluorescence of the free and the bound inhibitor. For the Qi center, 2-n-nonyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide and for the Qo center (E)-beta-methoxyacrylate-stilbene (MOA-stilbene) were used as fluorescing inhibitors. The experiments could be extended to other, non-fluorescing inhibitors by competition analysis. Using this method we were able to compare the binding behaviour of Qi and Qo center inhibitors under different redox states of the enzyme using the same experimental set up. We studied the competition between inhibitors of the cytochrome c reductase representative for all subgroups and demonstrated that at least three inhibitor binding sites exist, two located in the Qo center, one located in the Qi center. Determination of the dissociation constants of the oxidized, the partially reduced and the fully reduced enzyme showed that inhibitor binding at the Qi center is not redox-dependent. In contrast, the binding of MOA-stilbene to the Qo center is decreased after reduction of the iron-sulfur center and cytochrome c1, whereas this redox change increases the affinity for a Qo center inhibitor of the hydroxynaphthoquinone type, 3-n-undecyl-2-hydroxynaphthoquinone. From these results, aware of the fact that the inhibitory mechanism at the Qo center is a non-competitive one, we made the hypothesis of a 'catalytic switch' to explain both the bifurcation of electron flow and the inhibition at the Qo center. A steric blockage of one of two conformational states could serve as a cogent explanation for the great structural variability of the inhibitors and differential effects on the redox centers exerted by the inhibitors. Moreover, the proposed 'switch' gives some insight into other experimental results which are difficult to explain with the ubiquinone cycle as currently formulated.""]",['eng'],"['Acrylates/metabolism', 'Acrylates/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cattle', 'Kinetics', 'Mathematics', 'Mitochondria, Heart/enzymology', 'Models, Theoretical', 'NADH Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Naphthoquinones/metabolism', 'Naphthoquinones/pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Protein Binding', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence/methods', 'Stilbenes/metabolism', 'Stilbenes/pharmacology']","['Acrylates', 'Naphthoquinones', 'Stilbenes', '3-methoxy-2-(2-styrylphenyl)propenic acid methyl ester (103455-29-4)', '2-hydroxy-3-undecyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (41245-59-4)', 'NADH Dehydrogenase (EC 1.6.99.3)']"

Frozen hydrated sections were prepared from cryofixed tissues by ultracryomicrotomy at -125 degrees C. Sections were subsequently freeze-dried by increasing the temperature to -100 degrees C. The latter temperature was maintained throughout both the structural and elemental analyses. In cells from normal, rachitic, and vitamin D-treated [CC] animals the brush border from lanthanum-infused tissues was electron dense and calcium-lanthanum positive by x-ray analysis. In the absence of lanthanum, i.e., sucrose-infused duodena, the microvilli were still calcium positive. In the terminal web region of normal and CC-treated enterocytes, numerous, apparently interconnected, tubules and vesicles were seen. Vacuole-like structures were also seen. Such structures were especially prominent in the enterocytes from the vitamin-treated [CC] animals. Except for the vacuoles, the tubules and vesicles were electron dense in the lanthanum-infused duodena, and clear in sucrose-infused tissues. In both instances, the structures were calcium positive. Similar, but even larger structures were seen below the terminal web. Here however, the tubules and vesicles seemed to be organized into multiple complex interconnecting networks, i.e., tubulo-vesicular complexes. Both the tubules and the vesicles seemed to be interconnected via smaller channel-like entities. The extensiveness of this structure was better appreciated in the enterocytes from lanthanum-infused tissues, where it appeared similar in structure and complexity to an en face view of the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle. These intestinal complexes were less well developed, decreased in number, and quite often absent, in the apical cytoplasm of absorptive cells from rachitic chicks. In the enterocytes from animals treated for 24 hours with 1,25-DHCC, the same highly developed tubulo-vesicular networks were again seen in the enterocyte apical cytoplasm. They were even more developed in the 1,25-DHCC-treated animals. All structures were intensely calcium positive in enterocytes from both the lanthanum- and the sucrose-infused preparations. Numerous endocytotic (pinocytotic) vesicles were seen at the lumenal plasmalemma. Similar structures were also apparent in the terminal web region of the 1,25-DHCC-treated enterocytes. Exocytotic vesicles were seen at the apical aspect of the lateral cell membrane, below the level of the junctional complex.

Instability of Mex- has previously been shown as a population phenotype of LCLs. We examined whether Mex- as a cellular phenotype is spontaneously convertible or not. At the population doubling number (PDN) 23 after recloning, two out of 15 independent subcultures derived from a Mex- LCL, AT1-1, were found to contain a small fraction of Mex+ cells after treatment with 1-(4-amino-2-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl)methyl-3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitrosourea (ACNU). Three Mex+ subclones were identified without exposure to ACNU among 486 subclones from replica plating of an expanded Mex- clone (PDN30). The rate of spontaneous conversion was estimated to be in the range of 10(-8)-10(-7) per cell per generation by the fluctuation analyses on two Mex- subclones. These results strongly support the hypothesis that Mex- as a cellular phenotype is spontaneously convertible to Mex+.']",['eng'],"['Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Gene Conversion', 'Guanine/analogs & derivatives', 'Guanine/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Methyltransferases/genetics', 'Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'Nimustine/pharmacology', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase', 'Phenotype']","['Nimustine (0S726V972K)', 'Guanine (5Z93L87A1R)', 'O-(6)-methylguanine (9B710FV2AE)', 'Methyltransferases (EC 2.1.1.-)', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.63)']"

The results from 32 respondents demonstrated that 50% of the previous nonflossers were still flossing regularly (i.e., two or more times per week) and of these new regular flossers, 85% were using the floss-holding device while the remaining 15% preferred flossing by hand.

Of 790 singleton pregnancies followed to term, 71 (9.0%) planned home births, 510 (64.6%) planned clinic births, and 209 (26.5%) planned hospital births. Of those planning clinic or home birth, 73% gave birth outside the hospital as planned (44 at home and 379 in the clinic), 81 (14%) changed plans prenatally and gave birth in a local hospital, 46 (8%) were transferred to the local hospital intrapartum, and 29 (5%) were referred to tertiary care. Primiparas who initially chose OHB were more likely than multiparas to give birth in a hospital (46% vs 16%). Controlling retrospectively for obstetric risk and parity, there were few differences in outcome between local hospital and out-of-hospital births. The observed rates of serious complications for OHB were low, but overall, 27% of those initially considered candidates for birth outside the hospital required a change to a higher level of care. For primiparas initially planning clinic or home birth, discriminant analysis revealed five variables that together might have improved the prediction of the eventual decision for hospital delivery in 46%. Clinical pelvimetry was the most powerful variable, in keeping with the finding that most intrapartum transfers were for arrests of labor.

A comparison with the mutagenicity in S. typhimurium TA100.'],"['17 monofunctional methanesulphonates of widely varying structures were investigated in the SOS chromotest using the E. coli strain PQ37. All compounds tested were positive in this assay. The monofunctional methanesulphonates in general possess low SOSiP values. Five of the compounds tested i.e. iBMS, NpMS, 2 PhPMS, PkMS and 1,3-DC12PMS (for abbreviations see Table 1) did not show increasing beta-galactosidase activity and both the positive induction factors and the positive SOSiP values resulted from the toxicity correction as performed according to Quillardet and Hofnung (1985). In general methanesulphonates with a higher SN1 reactivity, in particular the secondary compounds, showed clear genotoxic activities whereas those possessing low SN1 reactivities (primary compounds) induced a low SOS repair indicating that the alkylation of O-atoms in the DNA bases contributes more to the induction of SOS repair in strain PQ37 than N-alkylations. The only exception was methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) which possessed a very high SN2 reactivity but a rather low SN1 reactivity. It had the highest SOSiP value of all tested methanesulphonates. No dependence of the genotoxicity on the SN2 reactivity could be found in this series. In general the phenyl-substituted methanesulphonates showed higher SOSiP values, which is presumably due to their relatively high SN1 reactivities and their relatively long life times in aqueous systems. There is a clear relationship between SN1 reactivities and the SOSiP values: the SOSiP values increase with rising SN1 reactivities reaching a maximum at iPMS after which the genotoxicities decrease due to the decreasing life times. The compounds with very high SN1 reactivities also possess very high hydrolysis rates. A good correlation could be established between the mutagenicities in S. typhimurium TA100 and the SOS chromotest (strain PQ37). Only 4 small deviations from this correlation could be found. The reasons for these deviations are discussed.']",['eng'],"['Alkylation', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Escherichia coli/drug effects', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Hydrolysis', 'Mesylates/toxicity', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'SOS Response (Genetics)/drug effects', 'Salmonella typhimurium/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']","['Mesylates', 'beta-Galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23)']"

Most of the techniques used so far (e.g. the super-syringe technique) need an apneic period of approximately 60-120 s, in which the pulmonary gas volume is reduced by the continuing oxygen uptake. Thus, a bias of 200-400 ml in volume is superimposed on the record. In contrast to the super-syringe technique, a new automatic procedure has been developed for which no apneic period is needed. This technique is called the PEEP wave technique: it is based on the imbalance between inspiratory and expiratory volumes after a sudden change in PEEP. The software of a Dräger Evita respirator was adapted to allow automatic application of a special sequence of respiratory cycles with stepwise increase and decreases in PEEP between two preselectable borderline levels. The equipment is switched to the next PEEP level when the difference between two consecutive expiratory tidal volumes is less than 15 ml. After the highest level of PEEP is reached the procedure is reversed until PEEP returns to its initial value.

Such LCLs have been designated Mex-, while the proficient LCLs are Mex+. Our determinations of O6-AGT activity as a function of cellular protein concentration on 37 previously-established LCLs disclosed that the expression of the enzyme was high in 14 (Mex+) and barely detectable in 16 (Mex-). The other seven LCLs showed intermediate activity of the enzyme. By contrast, all of the 28 LCLs that we newly established contained high enzyme activity, implying that they consisted of mainly Mex+ cells. Since the conventional O6-AGT assay on Mex+ cell populations was not capable of detecting the co-existence of Mex- cells as a minor component, we attempted to determine the proportion of Mex- phenotype in newly-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell clones which had been established directly on semisolid agar. All of the 15 independent clones derived from a single blood sample also showed high O6-AGT activity, rendering it unlikely that Epstein-Barr virus transformation per se was responsible for the generation of Mex- LCLs. These results collectively indicate that Mex+ cells predominate in LCLs shortly after establishment and also suggest that the possible growth advantage for Mex- cells should play an important role in the subsequent development of Mex- LCLs during the long-term culture in vitro.']",['eng'],"['Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'Nimustine/toxicity', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase', 'Phenotype']","['Nimustine (0S726V972K)', 'Methyltransferases (EC 2.1.1.-)', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.63)']"

This protocol was made valid in 6 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) admitted to a coronary care unit, 24 h after the onset of pain. From both the i.v. and oral plasma level data, the pharmacokinetic parameter alterations of MEX and its hydroxymethylmexiletine metabolite (OH MEX) were evaluated over a week's period. The results presented here demonstrate that a twice daily oral SR MEX administration, starting at the end of MEX infusion, maintains the therapeutic concentrations of MEX (750-2000 ng/ml) previously achieved by infusion therapy (at 48 h, end of infusion, mean +/- SD = 1393 +/- 325 ng/ml; at 60 h, mean +/- SD = 1434 +/- 376 ng/ml; at 96 h, mean +/- SD = 1423 +/- 367 ng/ml.

In an effort to move closer to the HD gene, with the eventual goal of identifying the gene itself, we have applied the technique of chromosome jumping to this region. A 200-kilobase jumping library has been constructed, and a jump from D4S10 has been obtained and its approximate distance verified by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Two restriction fragment length polymorphisms have been identified at the jump locus, which is denoted D4S81. Linkage analysis of previously identified recombinants between D4S10 and HD or D4S10 and D4S43 shows that in two of five events the jump has crossed the recombination points. This unequivocally orients D4S10 and D4S81 on the chromosome, provides additional markers for HD, and suggests that recombination frequency in this region of chromosome 4 may be increased, so that the physical distance from D4S10 to HD may not be as large as originally suspected.']",['eng'],"['Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Huntington Disease/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length']",

To address this situation, a general human chromosome jumping library was constructed that allows the cloning of DNA sequences approximately 100 kilobases away from any starting point in genomic DNA. As an illustration of its usefulness, this library was searched for a jumping clone, starting at the met oncogene, which is a marker tightly linked to the cystic fibrosis gene that is located on human chromosome 7.

The antisera were used to detect the two electron transferases in control and GA II fibroblasts by immunoblotting. Fibroblasts from three unrelated GA II patients were deficient in immunologically detectable ETF:QO and extracts from these three fibroblast lines contained no detectable ETF:QO catalytic activity. Fibroblasts from parents of two of these patients had ETF:QO activity intermediate between activities in control fibroblasts and fibroblasts from the patients. These data indicate that the primary defect in these patients is a deficiency of ETF:QO and that the mode of transmission of the gene is autosomal recessive. Fibroblasts from two other patients with severe GA II had normal levels of ETF-QO activity and antigen but were deficient in immunoreactive ETF. These findings show that GA II results from a deficiency of ETF in some patients and ETF:QO in others.

Infusion for 20 h of either human PTH-(1-34) (except at 800 pmol/h) or cAMP did not significantly change the plasma levels of calcium and phosphorus compared with those in thyroparathyroidectomized rats given 125 ng 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to induce renal 24-hydroxylase activity. On the other hand, human PTH-(1-34) markedly inhibited renal 24-hydroxylase activity and stimulated 1-hydroxylase activity. The effective concentration of human PTH-(1-34) was much lower for inhibiting 24-hydroxylase than for stimulating 1-hydroxylase activity. Infusion of less than 100 nmol/h cAMP similarly inhibited 24-hydroxylase activity without enhancing 1-hydroxylase activity. Either theophylline (1.0 mumol/h) or a submaximal dose (25 pmol/h) of human PTH-(1-34) alone inhibited 24-hydroxylase activity only slightly, but the concomitant infusion of both chemicals markedly inhibited 24-hydroxylase activity without stimulating 1-hydroxylase activity.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the dose responsivity of this perfused intestinal calcium transport system for 1,25(OH)2D3 and some structurally related congeners. The dose-response curve was biphasic for all compounds studied; for 1,25(OH)2D3 initial stimulation of transport was detected at only 30 pM [the plasma concentration of 1,25(OH)2D3 is normally 125 pM] while maximal stimulation was 154% above control at a concentration of 650 pM. Above 650 pM 1,25(OH)2D3 the stimulation fell off sharply and transport had returned to basal levels by 1.3 nM.

At all calcium concentrations used net secretion of calcium was observed. The s to m flux of the simultaneously measured paracellular marker mannitol at all calcium concentrations was remarkably higher than the m to s flux, resulting in net mannitol secretion.

Of the 61% who completed the questionnaire, 65% gave advice about intercurrent infection, a similar number gave advice about the use of prophylactic antibiotics before certain surgical procedures, with less than half of the patients receiving any written instructions about inter-current infection, and less than a quarter of the patients receiving any written instructions about antibiotic prophylaxis. 36% of the respondents were confused as to what to advise or ignored the problem. The reality of late infection is discussed and a policy to minimise the risk of late infection in prosthetic joints is presented for consideration.']",['eng'],"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Joint Diseases/drug therapy', 'Joint Diseases/prevention & control', 'Joint Prosthesis/adverse effects', 'Premedication', 'Sepsis/drug therapy', 'Sepsis/prevention & control', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",['Anti-Bacterial Agents']

PEEP is thought to increase PaO2 by alveolar recruitment, which in turn, has been hypothesized to play a decisive role in pulmonary recovery. One hundred and eighteen patients were followed prospectively, and after development of decreased PaO2, randomized to receive recruitive PEEP (determined by blood gas criteria) or supportive PEEP (the minimal PEEP required to maintain PaO2 above 60 mm Hg on .5 inspired O2 fraction (FIO2). No prognostic factors were significantly different between the two groups. Recruitive PEEP application in 22 patients yielded a significantly increased incidence of hypotension (55 percent), pneumothorax (20 percent), and death during treatment (27 percent) when compared to the 28 supportive PEEP patients who had no hypotension or pneumothorax and only one death during treatment (4 percent). After PEEP treatment, deaths in each group were similar (19 percent and 15 percent, respectively). We find no evidence that PEEP treatment promotes beneficial outcomes and conclude that recruitment attempts may be harmful.']",['eng'],"['Humans', 'Hypotension/etiology', 'Hypoxia/prevention & control', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Pneumothorax/etiology', 'Positive-Pressure Respiration/adverse effects', 'Positive-Pressure Respiration/methods', 'Postoperative Care', 'Prospective Studies', 'Random Allocation', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult/therapy', 'Ventilators, Mechanical']",

Thus, right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and wall motion score (WMS) were assessed in 14 patients with ventricular tachycardia before antiarrhythmic therapy, during MEX and Q monotherapies, and during combination therapy. During monotherapy, the daily doses and serum drug levels were: MEX, 621 mg/day and 3.4 microM/L; Q, 1573 mg/day and 8.3 microM/L, respectively. With combination therapy, the daily doses and serum drug levels were: MEX, 636 mg/day and 3.3 microM/L; Q, 1643 mg/day and 9.5 microM/L, respectively. Drug therapy did not affect group LVEF (drug free = 36 +/- 19%, MEX = 34 +/- 18%, Q = 36 +/- 19%, and combination MEX-Q = 35 +/- 19%), RVEF (drug free = 34 +/- 11%, MEX = 35 +/- 11%, Q = 36 +/- 13%, and combination MEX-Q = 36 +/- 12%), or WMS. Ventricular function reserve was assessed in five patients. Drug therapy did not affect group exercise LVEF (drug free = 44 +/- 14%, MEX = 42 +/- 12%, Q = 43 +/- 13%, and MEX-Q = 45 +/- 12%), RVEF (drug free = 38 +/- 10%, MEX = 40 +/- 11%, Q = 39 +/- 12%, and MEX-Q = 40 +/- 12%), WMS, or exercise duration.
