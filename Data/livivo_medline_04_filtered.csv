Healthy adult male volunteers were given a single oral dose of [14C]-rosuvastatin 20 mg (20 mL [14C]-rosuvastatin solution, nominally containing 50 microCi radioactivity). Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected up to 10 days after dosing. Tolerability assessments were made up to 10 days after dosing (trial completion) and at a follow-up visit within 14 days of trial completion.!##!Results!#!Six white male volunteers aged 36 to 52 years (mean, 43.7 years) participated in the trial. The geometric mean peak plasma concentration (C(max)) of rosuvastatin was 6.06 ng/mL and was reached at a median of 5 hours after dosing. At C(max), rosuvastatin accounted for approximately 50% of the circulating radioactive material. Approximately 90% of the rosuvastatin dose was recovered in feces, with the remainder recovered in urine. The majority of the dose (approximately 70%) was recovered within 72 hours after dosing; excretion was complete by 10 days after dosing. Metabolite profiles in feces indicated that rosuvastatin was excreted largely unchanged (76.8% of the dose). Two metabolites-rosuvastatin-5S-lactone and N-desmethyl rosuvastatin-were present in excreta. [14C]-rosuvastatin was well tolerated; 2 volunteers reported 4 mild adverse events that resolved without treatment.!##!Conclusions!#!The majority of the rosuvastatin dose was excreted unchanged. Given the absolute bioavailability (20%) and estimated absorption (approximately 50%) of rosuvastatin, this finding suggests that metabolism is a minor route of clearance for this agent.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological Availability', 'Carbon Isotopes', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fluorobenzenes/blood', 'Fluorobenzenes/pharmacokinetics', 'Fluorobenzenes/urine', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/blood', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/urine', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Middle Aged', 'Pyrimidines/blood', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacokinetics', 'Pyrimidines/urine', 'Rosuvastatin Calcium', 'Sulfonamides/blood', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacokinetics', 'Sulfonamides/urine']","['Carbon Isotopes', 'Fluorobenzenes', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines', 'Sulfonamides', 'Rosuvastatin Calcium (83MVU38M7Q)']"

There were significant linear correlations between daily doses of morphine and plasma concentrations (molar base) of morphine, M3G and M6G for both routes of administration. The oral-to-intravenous relative ratios of the regression coefficients were 2.9 for morphine and 1.8 for morphine + M6G. The morphine kinetic variables were not significantly influenced by any hepato-renal biochemical markers. These results support the commonly used oral-to-intravenous relative potency ratio of 1:2 to 1:3 in patients with cancer pain receiving chronic morphine treatment.']",['eng'],"['Administration, Oral', 'Aged', 'Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage', 'Analgesics, Opioid/blood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Parenteral', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Morphine/administration & dosage', 'Morphine/blood', 'Morphine Derivatives/blood', 'Neoplasms/blood', 'Neoplasms/complications', 'Pain/blood', 'Pain/drug therapy', 'Pain/etiology', 'Palliative Care']","['Analgesics, Opioid', 'Morphine Derivatives', 'morphine-6-glucuronide (64Y9KYM60R)', 'Morphine (76I7G6D29C)', 'morphine-3-glucuronide (O27Z9CH39A)']"

M14719718,['Psychological aspects of interventional therapy.'],"['This discussion is not, nor could it hope to be, an exhaustive examination of all of the various interventional therapies. Instead, it is intended to highlight the potential contribution of psychosocial factors. These factors may vary to some degree or another depending on the specific procedure, but clearly play a role whenever the desired outcome involves a reduction in subjective pain, alteration in the adaptiveness with which the patient responds to the experience of pain, and quality of life. Many notables, including Dr. Michael Cousins, have echoed the importance of incorporating interventional therapies into an interdisciplinary approach. Yet, there seems to be a preponderance of ""block shops"". Even when used for diagnostic or prognostic purposes, the impact of psychosocial variables and the potential relevance of a meaningful behavioral or psychologic evaluation cannot be overstated. It is easy to understand how the reader might conclude that immersing oneself in the minutiae of all these variables could lead to a feeling of intellectual paralysis when it comes to evaluating the data and arriving at a conclusion or diagnosis. However, ignoring these psychosocial variables and their complex interaction does not constitute a solution. This is particularly true in considering discography where, depending on the criteria applied, the percent of ""false positives"" can vary from 0% to as much as 40%. The implication for the performing of ""unnecessary"" spine surgery is obvious. The thoughtful practitioner will be mindful of the role of psychosocial variables in so far as they are thought to be relevant in a particular case. The overall contribution of psychosocial variables to the application of interventional therapies for the diagnosis and treatment of pain can be overlooked and ignored, but not denied. A certain percentage of patients will respond in a predictable, desirable or positive fashion purely on a statistical basis. Historically, and there seems to be no reason to believe this will change in the immediate future, the degree to which the psychosocial variables are considered is left up to the interventionalist. Some are content to perform a directed procedure or therapy concerned only, and sometimes to a less than sufficient degree, with the technical adequacy of the procedure. Others will appreciate the role of human factors including those of the practitioner and patient alike, and strive not only for a statistically derived outcome but the best possible outcome for a given patient. Psychosocial factors can sometimes take on the character of ""nuisance variables"". However, it is hard not to wonder how much care each would want to have given to these factors if one were on the other end of the needle.']",['eng'],"['Disease Management', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pain/classification', 'Pain/psychology', 'Pain Management']",

M14740565,['[Active involvement of pharmacists in initial treatments for acute poisoning and overdosed patients in the intensive care unit].'],"['We have developed guidelines of pharmaceutical activity which describes how pharmacists are actively involved in supporting the initial treatment of poisoning and overdosed patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). These guidelines are derived from the original procedural manual that consisted of protocol charts. The charts provide the pharmacist including ICU staff members with directions for the collection of clinical information and the forms to use for documentation. We focused on appropriate collection and proper preservation of collected samples in order to perform diagnostic analysis when needed. The original Information Record Form, completed by the participating pharmacist, documents all information regarding the patient\'s care. This record provides for integration of the diverse and complicated clinical information of the patient so that the physician can gain a comprehensive picture of the patient. The guidelines, manual book, materials for sample collection and the Information Record Form are stored in a container called the ""Poisoning Aid Set"", which will be available in the ICU. The guidelines are activated once an emergency call from paramedics is received regarding a suspected poisoning patient. According to the guidelines, the emergency room (ER) physician immediately contacts the pharmacist who will provide his professional services as a member of the treatment team. We have applied these guidelines to 29 poisoning patients and have critically evaluated for effectiveness. Early participation by pharmacists, by reviewing timely, accurate and competent clinical information enabled the pharmacist to identify the suspected drug from the biological samples obtained. From our experiences, we conclude that this active involvement of pharmacist in the initial treatment of poisoning and overdosed patients in the ICU was both supportive and beneficial to the patient. In addition, the participation of pharmacist as a member of a treatment team provided an excellent opportunity to collaborate with the entire ICU staff members.']",['jpn'],"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Drug Information Services', 'Drug Overdose/diagnosis', 'Drug Overdose/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Patient Care Team', 'Pharmacists', 'Poisoning/diagnosis', 'Poisoning/therapy', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic']",

Use of the labelled drugs enabled direct observations of the ionization equilibrium of the N-dimethyl group. A second derivative spectrophotometric study proved that 95-98% of the phenothiazine species in the sample solutions (200 microM phenothiazine in the presence of 27 mM PC SUV) were incorporated into the PC bilayer, which simplified the calculation of pKm values by allowing that the phenothiazines in the aqueous phase could be neglected. The pKm values were calculated from the chemical shift dependence of the N-dimethyl 13C NMR signal on the pH value of sample solutions. The pKm values obtained were smaller than those measured in aqueous solutions by about one unit. The existence of cholesterol (30 mol%) in the PC bilayer showed little effect on the pKm values, suggesting that cholesterol in the bilayer does not largely affect the interfacial region where the N-dimethyl group of the incorporated phenothiazines is located. The results offered clear evidence for the pKm decrease and provided their precise values.']",['eng'],"['Carbon Isotopes', 'Chlorpromazine/chemistry', 'Cholesterol/chemistry', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Lipid Bilayers/chemistry', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/methods', 'Phenothiazines/chemistry', 'Phosphatidylcholines/chemistry', 'Titrimetry', 'Triflupromazine/chemistry']","['Carbon Isotopes', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Phenothiazines', 'Phosphatidylcholines', 'Cholesterol (97C5T2UQ7J)', 'Triflupromazine (RO16TQF95Y)', 'Chlorpromazine (U42B7VYA4P)']"

We then compared these parameters statistically in both groups using Mann-Whitney's U test.

Aquatica gigantea) canopy during two growing seasons. An additional aim of this study was to determine how nitrogen is partitioned in the canopy and whether Rubisco and chlorophyll serve as sources of nitrogen. During both growing seasons, the total activity and the amount of Rubisco were high in young, sun-exposed leaves and decreased as the leaves aged and became shaded. In 1985, the specific activity was low (on average 0.8 micromol mm(-1) mg(-1) Rubisco protein) compared with the values obtained in 1986 (on average 1.8 micromol min(-1) mg(-1) Rubisco protein). These differences in the specific activity of Rubisco between the two years might be associated with changes in partitioning of nitrogen. During the cool summer of 1985, about 20% of the total nitrogen was partitioned to Rubisco compared with about 13% during the warm summer of 1986. Rubisco comprised a high proportion (about 60%) of the total soluble protein throughout the 1985 growing season, whereas during the 1986 growing season, the proportion of Rubisco in the total soluble protein fraction was lower and decreased markedly as the leaves became shaded. Chlorophyll did not serve as a source of nitrogen in the canopy. On the contrary, the proportion of total nitrogen in chlorophyll increased with time, which indicates acclimation of the thylakoid membranes to decreasing irradiance. The degree of activation of Rubisco in samples collected in 1986 was high in young, sun-exposed leaves, which suggests that in these leaves, Rubisco may limit the rate of CO(2) uptake. In the shaded leaves of the lower canopy, the degree of activation of Rubisco was low, which indicates that in these leaves, photosynthesis is limited by factors other than Rubisco.']",['eng'],,

These data show that in populations of comparable socio-economic, environmental and geographic locations, tuberculosis and leprosy show very different transmission patterns. In general, in tuberculosis household contacts, in spite of exposure, infection did not proceed to clinical disease. In contrast, a significant number of leprosy household contacts developed clinical leprosy.

Relative to other statins, rosuvastatin possesses a greater number of binding interactions with HMG-CoA reductase and has a high affinity for the active site of the enzyme. Rosuvastatin is relatively hydrophilic and is selectively taken up by, and active in, hepatic cells. Rosuvastatin has the longest terminal half-life of the statins and is only minimally metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP 450) enzyme system with no significant involvement of the 3A4 enzyme. Consistent with this finding is the absence of clinically significant drug interactions between rosuvastatin and other drugs known to inhibit CYP 450 enzymes. In patients with hypercholesterolemia, rosuvastatin 10-40 mg has been shown to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels by 52-63%, as well as increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels by up to 14% and reduce triglycerides (TG) by up to 28%. Studies have shown that rosuvastatin is superior to atorvastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin in reducing LDL-C and favorably modifying other components of the atherogenic lipid profile. The significant decreases in LDL-C with rosuvastatin treatment should help to improve attainment of lipid goals and reduce the requirement for dose titration. In addition, the effects of rosuvastatin on HDL-C and TG levels will be of benefit in treating patients with abnormalities such as mixed dyslipidemia and the metabolic syndrome. Rosuvastatin is well tolerated, with a safety profile comparable with that of other currently available statins.']",['eng'],"['Drug Interactions', 'Fluorobenzenes/pharmacology', 'Fluorobenzenes/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Hyperlipidemias/drug therapy', 'Metabolic Syndrome/drug therapy', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Rosuvastatin Calcium', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']","['Fluorobenzenes', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines', 'Sulfonamides', 'Rosuvastatin Calcium (83MVU38M7Q)']"

M15038367,['Cerebral modeling and dynamic Bayesian networks.'],"[""The understanding and the prediction of the clinical outcomes of focal or degenerative cerebral lesions, as well as the assessment of rehabilitation procedures, necessitate knowing the cerebral substratum of cognitive or sensorimotor functions. This is achieved by activation studies, where subjects are asked to perform a specific task while data of their brain functioning are obtained through functional neuroimaging techniques. Such studies, as well as animal experiments, have shown that sensorimotor or cognitive functions are the offspring of the activity of large-scale networks of anatomically connected cerebral regions. However, no one-to-one correspondence between activated networks adn functions can be found. Our research aims at understanding how the activation of large-scale networks derives from cerebral information processing mechanisms, which can only explain apparently conflicting activation data. Our work falls at the crossroads of neuroimaging interpretation techniques and computational neuroscience. Since knowledge in cognitive neuroscience is permanently evolving, our research aims more precisely at defining a new modeling formalism and at building a flexible simulator, allowing a quick implementation of the models, for a better interpretation of cerebral functional images. It also aims at providing plausible models, at eht level of large-scale networks, of cerebral information processing mechanisms in humans. In this paper, we propose a formalism, based on dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs), that respects the following constraints: an oriented, networks architecture, whose nodes (the cerebral structures) can all be different, the implementation of causality--the activation of the structure is caused by upstream nodes' activation--the explicit representation of different time scales (from 1 ms for the cerebral activity to many seconds for a PET scan image acquisition), the representation of cerebral information at the integrated level of neuronal populations, the imprecision of functional neuroimaging data, the nonlinearity and the uncertainty in cerebral mechanisms, and brain's plasticity (learning, reorganization, modulation). One of the main problems, nonlinearity, has been tackled thanks to new extensions of the Kalman filter. The capabilities of the formalism's current version are illustrated by the modeling of a phoneme categorization process, explaining the different cerebral activations in normal and dyslexic subjects.""]",['eng'],"['Bayes Theorem', 'Brain Diseases/pathology', 'Brain Diseases/rehabilitation', 'Brain Injuries/pathology', 'Brain Injuries/rehabilitation', 'Cerebral Cortex/physiology', 'Cognition Disorders/etiology', 'Cognition Disorders/rehabilitation', 'Dyslexia', 'Humans', 'Prognosis', 'Tomography, Emission-Computed']",

However, no test is 100% accurate in its assessment of ADHD. This study introduces a stochastic assessment combining psychometric tests with previously reported (Consistency Index) and newly developed (Alpha Blockade Index) EEG-based physiological markers of ADHD. The assessment utilizes classical Bayesian inference to refine after each step the probability of ADHD of each individual. In a pilot study involving six college females with ADHD and six matched controls, the assessment achieved correct classification for all ADHD and non-ADHD participants. In comparison, the classification of ADHD versus non-ADHD participants was < 85% for any one of the tests separately. The procedure significantly improved the score separation between ADHD versus non-ADHD groups. The final average probabilities for ADHD were 76% for the ADHD group and 8% for the control group. These probabilities correlated (r = .87) with the Brown ADD scale and (r = .84) with the ADHD-Symptom Inventory used for the screening of the participants. We conclude that, although each separate test was not completely accurate, a combination of several tests classified correctly all ADHD and all non-ADHD participants. The application of the proposed assessment is not limited to the specific tests used in this study--the assessment represents a general paradigm capable of accommodating a variety of ADHD tests into a single diagnostic assessment.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/diagnosis', 'Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/physiopathology', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Electroencephalography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Pilot Projects', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Psychometrics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",

Further circumstantial evidence for this link was found in the common risk factors for ovarian cancer and endometriosis. These risk factors influence retrograde menstruation and endometriosis in the same positive or negative way. Based on data in the literature, the prevalence of endometriosis in epithelial ovarian cancer has been calculated to be 4.5, 1.4, 35.9, and 19.0% for serous, mucinous, clear-cell and endometrioid ovarian carcinoma, respectively. The risk of malignant transformation in ovarian endometriosis was calculated at 2.5% but this might be an underestimate. In addition, some authors described atypical endometriosis in a spatial and chronological association with ovarian cancer. Finally, molecular studies have detected common alterations in endometriosis and ovarian cancer. These data suggest that some tumours, especially endometrioid and clear-cell carcinomas, can arise from endometriosis. Moreover, endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer represents a distinct clinical entity, with a more favourable biological behaviour, given a lower stage distribution and better survival than non-endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer.']",['eng'],"['Adenocarcinoma, Clear Cell/etiology', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Endometrioid/etiology', 'Endometriosis/complications', 'Endometriosis/epidemiology', 'Estrogen Replacement Therapy/adverse effects', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/etiology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/etiology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics', 'Prognosis']",

Exact binary logistic regression was employed.!##!Results!#!There were no significant differences between the intervention group in Full-Scale IQ 93.4 (14.2) [mean (SD)] versus the control group 89.6 (27.2), Verbal IQ 93.6 (16.4) versus 93.7 (26.8) or Performance IQ 94.3 (14.7) versus 86.3 (24.8). In the NIDCAP group 8/13 (62%) survived without disability and for the children with conventional care this ratio was 7/19 (37%). The corresponding ratios for surviving without mental retardation were 10/13 (77%) and 11/19 (58%), and for surviving without attention deficits 10/13 (77%) and 10/19 (53%). Overall, the differences were not statistically significant, although the odds ratio for surviving with normal behaviour was statistical significant after correcting for group imbalances in gestational age, gender, growth retardation and educational level of the parents.!##!Conclusion!#!Our trial suggests a positive impact by NIDCAP on behaviour at preschool age in a sample of infants born very prematurely. However, due to problems of recruitment less than half of the anticipated subjects were included in the study, which implies a low power and calls for caution in interpreting our findings. Larger trials in different cultural contexts are warranted.']",['eng'],"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child Development', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition Disorders/diagnosis', 'Cognition Disorders/etiology', 'Cognition Disorders/prevention & control', 'Developmental Disabilities/prevention & control', 'Disability Evaluation', 'Female', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Care/methods', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Premature/growth & development', 'Infant, Premature/physiology', 'Infant, Premature/psychology', 'Intensive Care, Neonatal/methods', 'Male', 'Outcome Assessment (Health Care)', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Wechsler Scales']",

He argued for regulatory constraint or ""proving by peer-reviewed publication"" before alerting the public. It is not a contradiction for me to currently argue against the public advertising of minimally invasive (MIS) total hip arthroplasty as not yet being in the best interest of the public. It is hard to remember a concept that has so captured both the public\'s and the surgical community\'s fancy as MIS. Patients are ""demanding"" MIS without knowing why. Surgeons are offering it as the next best, greatest thing without having developed the skill and experience to avoid the surgery\'s risks. If you put ""minimally invasive hip replacement"" into the Google search engine (http://www.google.com), you get 5,170 matches. If you put the same words in PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi), referencing the National Library of Medicine database, you get SEVENTEEN; none is really a peer-reviewed article.

The author provided all of the hypnosis in a manner similar to that taught by David Cheek. The goal was to reduce fear of birth and parenthood; to reduce anxiety; to reduce stress; to identify specific fears that might complicate the labor process (addressing them whenever possible); and to prepare women for the experience of labor. The attention-only group was matched to a no-contact comparison group. Women receiving prenatal hypnosis had significantly better outcomes than women who did not. Further assessment suggested that hypnosis worked by preventing negative emotional factors from leading to an complicated birth outcome. Attention only was associated with minimal differences in outcome over the no-contact group. The routine prenatal use of hypnosis could improve obstetric outcome.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Anxiety/diagnosis', 'Anxiety/psychology', 'Anxiety/therapy', 'Fear', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypnosis', 'Labor, Obstetric/physiology', 'Pregnancy/psychology', 'Prenatal Care', 'Social Support']",

The baseline study in 1990 identified 200 prevalent cases of dementia. The dementia-free cohort included 1,260 persons aged 75 and over. This was the sample used for the incidence study. We rescreened and selectively reexamined this group in 1995 using a two-phase procedure consisting of a screening interview at home using the MMSE.

The present study investigated R-States and stress symptom-patterns associated with listening to Mozart versus New Age music. Students (N = 63) were divided into three relaxation groups based on previously determined preferences. Fourteen listened to a 28-minute tape recording of Mozart\'s Eine Kleine Nachtmusik and 14 listened to a 28-minute tape of Steven Halpern\'s New Age Serenity Suite. Others (n = 35) did not want music and instead chose a set of popular recreational magazines. Participants engaged in their relaxation activity at home for three consecutive days for 28 minutes a session. Before and after each session, each person completed the Smith Relaxation States Inventory (Smith, 2001), a comprehensive questionnaire tapping 15 R-States as well as the stress states of somatic stress, worry, and negative emotion. Results revealed no differences at Session 1. At Session 2, those who listened to Mozart reported higher levels of At Ease/Peace and lower levels of Negative Emotion. Pronounced differences emerged at Session 3. Mozart listeners uniquely reported substantially higher levels of Mental Quiet, Awe and Wonder, and Mystery. Mozart listeners reported higher levels, and New Age listeners slightly elevated levels, of At Ease/Peace and Rested/Refreshed. Both Mozart and New Age listeners reported higher levels of Thankfulness and Love.

Moreover, disturbance of effective communication can cause neurological symptoms like apraxia, dyslexia or object agnosia. Interregional communication can be assessed by coherence analysis of synchronized neuronal oscillations, and has been referred to as synchrony or ""binding"". The concept of synchrony as a means of information coding is attractive, but its functional relevance has been challenged. We hypothesized that if synchrony is functionally relevant in humans, then more synchrony should determine better behavioral performance. Here, we show in a visuotactile integration task that the amount of low-frequency (7-13Hz), long-range electroencephalographic coherence between visual and sensorimotor cortex is significantly correlated with the level of performance. Trials with highest coherences were the most successful ones and vice versa in the absence of differences in regional activation measured as task-related spectral power. In summary, quantitatively linking the amount of long-range synchrony with the degree of behavioral success in humans, the present data suggest that the ability to generate topographically specific synchrony of high amplitude is functionally relevant for behavioral success. They also raise the possibility that the magnitude of regional activation is less representative of the efficacy of brain functioning than interregional synchrony.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Brain Mapping/methods', 'Electroencephalography/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Motor Cortex/physiology', 'Psychomotor Performance/physiology', 'Somatosensory Cortex/physiology', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Task Performance and Analysis', 'Touch/physiology', 'Visual Cortex/physiology', 'Visual Perception/physiology']",

One important factor relevant to drug monitoring is to what extent morphine, M6G and M3G serum concentrations fluctuate during stable morphine treatment.!##!Methods!#!We included twenty-nine patients admitted to a palliative care unit receiving oral morphine (n = 19) or continuous subcutaneous (sc) morphine infusions (n = 10). Serum concentrations of morphine, M6G and M3G were obtained at the same time on four consecutive days. If readmitted, the patients were followed for another trial period. Day-to-day variations in serum concentrations and ratios were determined by estimating the percent coefficient of variation (CV = (mean/SD) x100).!##!Results!#!The patients' median morphine doses were 90 (range; 20-1460) mg/24 h and 135 (range; 30-440) mg/24 h during oral and sc administration, respectively. Intraindividual fluctuations of serum concentrations estimated by median coefficients of day-to-day variation were in the oral group for morphine 46%, for M6G 25% and for M3G 18%. The median coefficients of variation were lower in patients receiving continuous sc morphine infusions (morphine 10%, M6G 13%, M3G 9%).!##!Conclusion!#!These findings indicate that serum concentrations of morphine and morphine metabolites fluctuate.

Chromosome 1 instability generally involves partial duplications, whole-arm translocations, or jumping translocations of 1q, identified by G-banding. To characterize this instability further, we performed spectral karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization with probes for satII/III (1q12), BCL9 (1q21), and IL6R (1q21) on the karyotypes of 44 patients with known 1q aberrations. In eight patients, segmental duplication of 1q12-21 and adjacent bands occurred on nonhomologous chromosomes. In five cases, the 1q first jumped to a nonhomologous chromosome, after which the 1q12-21 segment again duplicated itself 1-3 times. In three other cases, segmental duplications occurred after the 1q first jumped to a nonhomologous chromosome, where the proximal adjacent nonhomologous chromosome segment was duplicated prior to the 1q jumping or inserting itself into a new location. These cases demonstrate that satII/III DNA sequences are not only associated not only with the duplication of adjacent distal chromosome segments after translocation, but are also associated with the duplication and jumping/insertion of proximal nonhomologous chromosome segments. We have designated this type of instability as a jumping segmental duplication.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication', 'Genomic Instability/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics']",

Although some evidence suggests that using specific features of buildings and their immediate surroundings such as stairs can have a meaningful impact on health, the influences of the physical environment on physical activity at the building and site scale are not yet clear. While there is some research suggesting that people will be more active in buildings that have visible, accessible, pleasing, and supportive features, such as motivational point-of-decision prompts and well-designed stairs, there is only limited evidence to support that assertion. This paper reviews the available evidence linking design and site decisions to physical activity, and suggests a framework for connecting research and implementation strategies for creating activity-friendly buildings. In consideration of the kinds of physical activities associated with buildings and their sites, it is proposed that the form of buildings and sites affect physical activity at several spatial scales: the selection and design of sites with respect to a building's location on its site and within its immediate community and the provision and layout of site amenities; building design such as the programming, layout, and form of the building; and building element design such as the design and layout of elements such as stairs or exercise rooms. The paper concludes with an overview of opportunities for research and intervention strategies within the building industry, focusing on public buildings, which provide numerous high-leverage opportunities for linking research and implementation.""]",['eng'],"['Algorithms', 'Environment Design', 'Exercise', 'Facility Design and Construction', 'Humans']",
M15698926,['Contextual influence of TMS on the latency of saccades and vergence.'],"['This study examines the effects of TMS of the right PPC on the latency of saccades and vergence alone or combined and the role of experimental design. Two designs were used: pure blocks with exclusively no-TMS or TMS trials; mixed blocks in which no-TMS and TMS trials were interleaved; a control study with TMS of the primary motor cortex (pure blocks) was also conducted and showed no effects on latencies. In contrast, in the experiment with TMS of the PPC latencies for TMS trials increased relative to no-TMS trials for almost all eye movements (isolated saccades, convergence, divergence, and for saccade and divergence components of combined eye movements). However, such increase was significant for pure blocks only. In mixed blocks no difference between TMS and no-TMS was found mainly because the latency of no-TMS trials increased relative to corresponding latencies in pure blocks. A second study centered on isolated convergence and divergence confirmed the interaction between block-design and TMS effects, and showed significant TMS/no-TMS differences only for the pure design and for a design in which the rate of TMS trials was high (75%). Again, the absence of difference was due to increase of latency for no-TMS trials in mixed blocks with low rates of TMS trials (50% or 25%), but also to decreased effects for the TMS trials themselves. We conclude that latency of all eye movements, saccades and vergence is highly influenced by the context. Such a contextual factor is the number of TMS versus no-TMS trials within a block; low numbers of TMS trials (50% or less) increases baseline latencies. The design of mixed blocks with 50% or less of TMS trials should not be recommended as it underestimates the direct effects of TMS on cortical processing. In fact, the majority of TMS studies on eye movements do use paradigms with high rates of TMS trials (75% or more). Our study confirms the validity of such paradigms.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Cerebral Cortex/physiology', 'Convergence, Ocular/physiology', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Humans', 'Magnetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Reaction Time', 'Saccades/physiology']",
M15725350,['Transitions in care during the end of life: changes experienced following enrolment in a comprehensive palliative care program.'],"['BACKGROUND: Transitions in the location of care and in who provides such care can be extremely stressful for individuals facing death and for those close to them. The objective of this study was to describe the distribution of transitions in care experienced by palliative care patients following admission to a comprehensive palliative care program (PCP). A better understanding of these transitions may aid in reducing unnecessary change, help predict care needs, enhance transitions that improve quality of life, guide health care system communication links and maximize the cost-effective utilization of different care settings and providers. METHODS: Transition and demographic information pertaining to all patients registered in the PCP at the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre (QEII), Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2002 and who died on or prior to December 31, 2002 was extracted from the PCP database and examined. A transition was defined as either: (1) a change in location of where the patient was cared for by the PCP or, (2) a change in which clinical service provided care. Descriptive analysis provided frequencies and locations of transitions experienced from time of PCP admission to death and during the final two and four weeks of life, an examination of patient movement and a summary of the length of stay spent by patients at each care location. RESULTS: Over the five year period, 3974 adults admitted to the QEII PCP experienced a total of 5903 transitions (Mean 1.5; standard deviation 1.8; median 1). Patients with no transitions (28%) differed significantly from those who had experienced at least one transition with respect to survival time, age, location of death and diagnosis (p < 0.0001). The majority of patients were admitted to the PCP from various acute care units (66%). Although 54% of all transitions were made to the home, only 60% of these moves included care provided by PCP staff. During the last four weeks of life, 47% of patients experienced at least one transition; 36% during the final two weeks of life. Shorter stays in each location were evident when care was actively provided by the PCP. CONCLUSION: A relatively small number of patients under the care of the PCP at the end of life, made several transitions in care setting or service provider. These particular patients need closer scrutiny to understand why such transitions take place so that clinical programs may be designed or modified to minimize the transitions themselves or the impact transitions have on patients and families.']",['eng'],,

M15766272,"['Dynamics of glutathione conjugation and conjugate efflux in detoxification of the carcinogen, 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide: contributions of glutathione, glutathione S-transferase, and MRP1.']","['4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide (NQO) is a reactive electrophile with potent cytotoxic as well as genotoxic activities. NQO forms a conjugate, QO-SG, with glutathione, which greatly reduces its chemical reactivity. Previous studies demonstrated that glutathione S-transferase (GST) P1a-1a and multidrug resistance protein (MRP) 1/2 act in synergy to confer resistance to both cyto- and genotoxicities of NQO, whereas protection afforded by GSTP1a-1a or MRP alone was much less. To better understand the role of glutathione, GSTP1a-1a, and MRP1 in NQO detoxification, we have characterized the kinetics and cofactor requirements of MRP1-mediated transport of QO-SG and NQO. Additionally, using recombinant GSTP1a-1a and physiological conditions, we have examined the enzymatic and nonenzymatic formation of QO-SG. Results show that MRP1 supports efficient transport of QO-SG with a K(m) of 9.5 microM and a V(max) comparable to other good MRP1 substrates. Glutathione or its S-methyl analogue enhanced the rate of (3)H-QO-SG transport, whereas QO-SG inhibited the rate of (3)H-glutathione transport. These data favor a mechanism for glutathione-enhanced, MRP1-mediated QO-SG transport that does not involve cotransport of glutathione. NQO was not transported by MRP1 either alone or in the presence of S-methyl glutathione. Transport of (3)H-NQO was observed in the presence of glutathione, but uptake into MRP1-containing vesicles was entirely attributable to its conjugate, QO-SG, formed nonenzymatically. While the nonenzymatic rate was readily measurable, enzyme catalysis was overwhelmingly dominant in the presence of GSTP1a-1a (rate enhancement factor, (k(cat)/K(m))/k(2), approximately 3 x 10(6)). We conclude that MRP1 supports detoxification of NQO via efficient, glutathione-stimulated efflux of QO-SG. While nonenzymatic QO-SG formation and MRP1-mediated conjugate efflux result in low-level protection from cyto- and genotoxicities, this protection is greatly enhanced by coexpression of GSTP1-1 with MRP1. This result emphasizes the quantitative importance of enzyme-catalyzed conjugate formation, a crucial determinant of high-level, MRP-dependent protection of cells from NQO toxicity.']",['eng'],"['4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide/metabolism', '4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide/toxicity', 'Carcinogens/metabolism', 'Carcinogens/toxicity', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Glutathione/chemistry', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glutathione/physiology', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi', 'Glutathione Transferase/chemistry', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/physiology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Inactivation, Metabolic', 'Isoenzymes/chemistry', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/chemistry', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/physiology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Temperature', 'Thermodynamics', 'Transport Vesicles/chemistry', 'Transport Vesicles/metabolism']","['Carcinogens', 'Isoenzymes', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', '4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide (56-57-5)', 'GSTP1 protein, human (EC 2.5.1.18)', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi (EC 2.5.1.18)', 'Glutathione Transferase (EC 2.5.1.18)', 'Glutathione (GAN16C9B8O)', 'multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (Y49M64GZ4Q)']"

I: Comparison of Japan Diabetes Society-assigned values to those obtained by the Japanese and USA domestic standardization programmes and by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry reference laboratories.'],"['Background!#!The Committee on Standardization of Laboratory Testing Related to Diabetes Mellitus of the Japan Diabetes Society (JDS) previously recommended use of the primary calibrator (JDS Lot 1) prepared by the former Committee for Standardization of Glycohemoglobin for standardizing the measurement of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Owing to the depletion of vials of Lot 1 in March 2001, the present committee certified a new reference material, Lot 2, now distributed by the Health Care Technology Foundation (HECTEF). The standardization programme for HbA1c measurement in Japan is currently based on Lot 2, which has values assigned from within Lot 1; the Lot 1 values were consensus values based on assays by laboratories in the Japanese national quality control programme. In this study, for the purpose of international comparison and standardization, Lot 2 was assayed by the JDS reference laboratories, the National Glycoprotein Standardization Program (NGSP) in the USA, and by reference laboratories approved by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC).!##!Method!#!The HbA1c values of JDS Lot 2 were transferred from those assigned to Lot 1 using KO500, a high-resolution HPLC method, at three laboratories approved by the JDS committee. Subsequently, vials of JDS Lot 2 were shipped to and assayed by the NGSP in the USA and 10 IFCC reference laboratories.!##!Result!#!The JDS-assigned HbA1c values (from Lot 1) are 4.04 for Level 1, 5.38 for Level 2, 7.32 for Level 3, 9.88 for Level 4, and 12.63 for Level 5, all expressed as a percentage of total haemoglobin. The values obtained by NGSP and the IFCC laboratories gave the following formulas: NGSP value(%)=JDS value(%)+0.3%; IFCC value(%)=1.068xJDS value(%)-1.741%.!##!Conclusion!#!Although the values obtained by the IFCC laboratories are significantly lower than the values assigned to Lot 2 by the JDS, the relationship is linear. In addition, standardization of HbA1c based on JDS Lot 2 is currently at a satisfactory level in Japan. As a result, the reassignment of values for Lot 2 to agree with the IFCC values should be relatively easy and will be done after all relevant parties agree to the change.']",['eng'],"['Blood Chemical Analysis/methods', 'Blood Chemical Analysis/standards', 'Calibration', 'Diabetes Mellitus/diagnosis', 'Glycated Hemoglobin A/analysis', 'Glycated Hemoglobin A/standards', 'Humans', 'International Cooperation', 'Japan', 'Laboratories/standards', 'Quality Control', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'United States']",['Glycated Hemoglobin A']

The application of PEEP is expected to increase PaO2; however, it is generally agreed that simply using increased PaO2 as the end point is inappropriate. Four mechanisms have been proposed to explain the improved pulmonary function and gas exchange with PEEP: 1) increased functional residual capacity; 2) alveolar recruitment; 3) redistribution of extravascular lung water; and 4) improved ventilation-perfusion matching. The optimal method of applying PEEP is still controversial. The main effect of augmenting PEEP is maintain recruitment of alveolar units that were previously collapsed. Thus, since tidal volume is distributed to more alveoli, peak airway pressure is reduced and compliance is increased. During acute lung injury, and depending on the severity of lung disease, PEEP can markedly alter the compliance of the lung by alveolar recruitment. The greater the alveolar collapse and pulmonary edema, the more the compliance curve of the respiratory system shifts downward and to the right. As PEEP is applied and alveoli recruited, the pressure-volume curve shifts upward and to the left. Despite its intuitive benefit, there were very few controlled studies of the effects of PEEP on ARDS outcome and no prospective randomised controlled trial of PEEP has been ever carried out in patients with acute lung injury and/ or ARDS to evaluate its efficacy until recently.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Lung/physiopathology', 'Positive-Pressure Respiration', 'Respiration, Artificial/adverse effects', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult/physiopathology', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult/therapy', 'Respiratory Function Tests', 'Treatment Outcome']",

One specific form of breathing therapy, known as the Buteyko breathing technique (BBT) has received considerable attention, but there is a paucity of rigorous research evidence to support its recommendation for asthma patients. There are only four published clinical trials and two conference abstracts evaluating BBT. Although all have reported improvements in one or more outcome measures, results have not been consistent. This article provides the background to the BBT, reviews the available evidence for its use and examines the physiological hypothesis claimed to underpin it. In common with other therapies, BBT is not a standardised treatment modality. The BBT 'package' is complex, as it also includes advice and education about medication use, nutrition and exercise, and general relaxation. This makes it difficult, and possibly inappropriate, to attempt to tease out a single mechanism. Buteyko's theory relating to carbon dioxide levels and airway calibre is an attractive one, and has some basis in evidence from experimental studies. However, it is not known whether altering breathing patterns can raise carbon dioxide levels significantly, and there is currently insufficient evidence to confirm that this is the mechanism behind any effect that BBT may exert. Further research is necessary to establish unequivocally whether BBT is effective, and if so, how it may work.""]",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Asthma/drug therapy', 'Asthma/therapy', 'Breathing Exercises', 'Humans', 'Quality of Life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Respiration']",

However, despite opposition from medical authorities or the police, many western parents are increasingly adopting night-time infant caregiving patterns that include some co-sleeping, especially by those mothers who choose to breast feed. This review will show that the relationships between infant sleep patterns, infant sleeping arrangements and development both in the short and long term, whether having positive or negative outcomes, is anything but simple and the traditional habit of labelling one sleeping arrangement as being superior to another without an awareness of family, social and ethnic context is not only wrong but possibly harmful. We will show that there are many good reasons to insist that the definitions of different types of co-sleeping and bedsharing be recognised and distinguished. We will examine the conceptual issues related to the biological functions of mother-infant co-sleeping, bedsharing and what relationship each has to SIDS. At very least, we hope that the studies and data described in this paper, which show that co-sleeping at least in the form of roomsharing especially with an actively breast feeding mother saves lives, is a powerful reason why the simplistic, scientifically inaccurate and misleading statement 'never sleep with your baby' needs to be rescinded, wherever and whenever it is published.""]",['eng'],"['Beds', 'Breast Feeding', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Care/methods', 'Infant Care/standards', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Mother-Child Relations', 'Risk Factors', 'Sleep/physiology', 'Sudden Infant Death/etiology', 'Sudden Infant Death/prevention & control']",

In the dog, nonselective inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) increase Qo(2) and Qo(2)/T(na). Glomerular hemodynamic and reabsorptive consequences of NOS inhibition require angiotensin II (Ang II), implying an antagonistic relationship between nitric oxide and Ang II. Effects of NOS inhibition in the rat, the role of Ang II and the responsible NOS isoform have not been elucidated.!##!Methods!#!Kidney blood flow [renal blood flow (RBF)], glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and Qo(2)/T(na) were measured before and during intravenous administration of N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine (L-NMMA), a nonselective NOS inhibitor, in control and losartan (Ang II receptor blocker)-treated rats and rats administered S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline (SMTC), a NOS-1 inhibitor. Effects of SMTC on oxygen consumption were also examined in freshly harvested proximal tubules.!##!Results!#!L-NMMA and high-dose SMTC decreased RBF, but L-NMMA + losartan and low-dose SMTC did not. Qo(2)/T(na) increased in both L-NMMA groups. Both low- and high-dose SMTC also increased Qo(2)/T(na). SMTC increased Qo(2) in proximal tubules in vitro at presumed lower levels of vectorial NaCl transport. Results suggest this effect was not mediated by influences on sodium transport alone.!##!Conclusion!#!Nonselective NOS inhibition increases the oxygen costs of kidney function independent of Ang II.

Several lines of research are attempting to establish the neurobiological basis of dyslexia, and low-level sensory and motor deficits have been found in dyslexic populations; furthermore, behavioural and imaging data point to cerebellar dysfunction in dyslexia. To investigate this, normal readers (n=19) and children with developmental dyslexia (n=16) were asked to perform various cognitive, literacy, and balancing tasks. Children balanced on the left or right foot, with eyes open or closed, for a period of 10 s during which their movements were recorded with a motion-tracking system. Dyslexic children were less stable than the control children in both eyes-open conditions (left foot P=0.02, right foot P=0.012). While there were no group differences during the eyes-closed conditions, the dyslexic children dropped a foot to correct balance significantly more often than control children (P<0.05). Incidence analysis showed that 50% of the dyslexic group fell into the 'impaired' category on the eyes-open balancing tasks; when the mean balancing scores and the foot drops were considered, only three of our dyslexic children showed no evidence of balancing difficulties. There were strong correlations between reading and spelling scores and the mean eyes-open balancing score (r=0.52 and 0.44, respectively). Thus, while not all children with developmental dyslexia show impaired balancing skills, low-level motor dysfunction may be associated with impaired literacy development.

This paper provides an illustration of the potential effects that test reliability and measurement error can have on the diagnosis of dyslexia, with particular reference to discrepancy models. The roles of reliability and standard error of measurement (SEM) in classic test theory are also briefly reviewed. This is followed by illustrations of how SEM and test reliability can aid with the interpretation of a simple discrepancy-based formula of DD. It is proposed that a lack of consideration of test theory in the use of discrepancy-based models of DD can lead to misdiagnosis (both false positives and false negatives).

The condition appears in natural and obesity-created body folds. The friction in these folds can lead to a variety of complications such as secondary bacterial or fungal infections. The usual approach to managing intertrigo is to minimize moisture and friction with absorptive powders such as cornstarch or with barrier creams. Patients should wear light, nonconstricting, and absorbent clothing and avoid wool and synthetic fibers. Physicians should educate patients about precautions with regard to heat, humidity, and outside activities. Physical exercise usually is desirable, but patients should shower afterward and dry intertriginous areas thoroughly. Wearing open-toed shoes can be beneficial for toe web intertrigo.

In women with hyperperistalsis fragments of basal endometrium are detached during menstruation and transported into the peritoneal cavity. Fragments of basal endometrium have an increased potential of implantation and proliferation resulting in pelvic endometriosis. In addition, hyperperistalsis induces the proliferation of basal endometrium into myometrial dehiscencies. This results in endometriosis-associated adenomyosis with a prevalence of about 90%. Adenomyosis results in impaired directed sperm transport and thus constitutes an important cause of sterility in women with endometriosis. The principal mechanism of endometriosis/adenomyosis is the paracrine interference of endometrial estrogen with the cyclical endocrine control of archimyometrial peristalsis exerted by the ovary thus resulting in hyperperistalsis. Minimal endometriosis of the fertile women, endometriosis and adenomyosis of the infertile women and adenomyosis of the parous peri- and postmenopausal women are considered as phenotypes of a pathophysiological continuum with uterine peristalsis playing a prominent role.']",['ger'],"['Endometriosis/classification', 'Endometriosis/pathology', 'Endometriosis/physiopathology', 'Estrogens/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Uterus/physiology', 'Uterus/physiopathology']",['Estrogens']
M16199682,['Bedsharing and maternal smoking in a population-based survey of new mothers.'],"['Objective!#!Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) remains the number 1 cause of postneonatal infant death. Prone infant sleep position and maternal smoking have been established as risk factors for SIDS mortality. Some studies have found that bedsharing is associated with SIDS, but, to date, there is only strong evidence for a risk among infants of smoking mothers and some evidence of a risk among young infants of nonsmoking mothers. Despite the lack of convincing scientific evidence, bedsharing with nonsmoking mothers remains controversial. In some states, nonsmoking mothers are currently being told that they should not bedshare with their infants, and mothers of infants who died of SIDS are told that they caused the death of their infant because they bedshared. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between maternal smoking and bedsharing among Oregon mothers to explore whether smoking mothers, in contrast to nonsmoking mothers, are getting the message that they should not bedshare.!##!Methods!#!Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System surveys a stratified random sample, drawn from birth certificates, of women after a live birth. Hispanic and non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Native women, and non-Hispanic white women with low birth weight infants are oversampled to ensure sufficient numbers for stratified analysis. The sample then was weighted to reflect Oregon\'s population. In 1998-1999, 1867 women completed the survey (73.5% weighted response). The median time from birth to completion of the survey was 4 months. Women were asked whether they shared a bed with their infant ""always,"" ""almost always,"" ""sometimes,"" or ""never."" Frequent bedsharing was defined as ""always"" or ""almost always""; infrequent was defined as ""sometimes"" or ""never.""!##!Results!#!Of all new mothers, 35.2% reported bedsharing frequently (always: 20.5%; almost always: 14.7%) and 64.8% infrequently (sometimes: 41.4%; never: 23.4%). Bedsharing among postpartum smoking mothers was 18.8% always, 12.6% almost always, 45.1% sometimes, and 23.6% never; this was not statistically different from among nonsmoking mothers. Results for prenatal smokers were similar. When stratified by race/ethnicity, there was no association between smoking and bedsharing in any racial or ethnic group. In univariable and multivariable logistic regression, there were no statistical differences in frequent or any bedsharing among either prenatal or postpartum smoking mothers compared with nonsmokers; the adjusted odds ratio for postpartum smokers who frequently bedshared was 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42-1.25) and for any bedsharing was 1.05 (95% CI: 0.57-1.94). Results for prenatal smoking were similar. This is the first US population-based study to look at the prevalence of bedsharing among smoking and nonsmoking mothers. Bedsharing is common in Oregon, with 35.2% of mothers in Oregon reporting frequently bedsharing and an additional 41.4% sometimes bedsharing. There was no significant association between smoking and bedsharing for either prenatal or postpartum smokers among any racial or ethnic group. Smoking mothers were as likely to bedshare as nonsmoking mothers. The frequency of bedsharing in Oregon was similar to estimates from other sources. Our study has the advantage of being a population-based sample drawn from birth certificates, weighted for nonresponse.!##!Conclusions!#!Although a number of case series have raised concerns about the safety of mother-infant bedsharing, even among nonsmoking mothers, this has not yet been confirmed by careful, controlled studies. There have been 9 large-scale case-control studies of the relationship between bedsharing and SIDS. Three case-control studies did not stratify by maternal smoking status, but found no increased risk for SIDS. Six case control studies reported results stratified by maternal smoking status: 1 study, while asserting an association, provided an unexplained range of univariable odds ratios without CIs; 3 found no increased risk for older infants of nonsmoking mothers; and 2 found a risk only for infants <8-11 weeks of age. Despite the preponderance of evidence that bedsharing by nonsmoking mothers does not increase the risk for SIDS among older infants, the recent specter of bedsharing as a cause of SIDS, based on uncontrolled case series and medical examiners\' anecdotal experience, has led some medical examiners to label a death ""suffocation"" or ""overlay asphyxiation"" simply because the infant was bedsharing at the time of death. This ""diagnostic drift"" may greatly complicate future studies of the relationship between bedsharing and SIDS. Epidemiologic evidence shows that there is little or no increased risk for SIDS among infants of nonsmoking mothers but increased risk among infants of smoking mothers and younger infants of nonsmoking mothers. It seems prudent to discourage bedsharing among all infants <3 months old. Young infants brought to bed to be breastfed should be returned to a crib when finished. It would be worthwhile for other researchers to reanalyze their previous data to evaluate the consistency of the interaction of young infant age and bedsharing. Large controlled studies that include infants who are identified as dying from SIDS, asphyxia, suffocation, and sudden unexplained infant death, analyzed separately and in combination, are needed to resolve this and other issues involving bedsharing, including the problem of diagnostic drift. Recommendations must be based on solid scientific evidence, which, to date, does not support the rejection of all bedsharing between nonsmoking mothers and their infants. Cribs should be available for those who want to use them. Nonsmoking mothers should not be pressured to abstain from bedsharing with their older infants; they should be provided with accurate, up-to-date scientific information. Infants also should not co-sleep with nonparents. In Oregon, if not elsewhere, the message that smoking mothers should not bedshare is not being disseminated effectively. Because it is not known whether the risk caused by smoking is associated with prenatal smoking, postpartum smoking, or both, bedsharing among either prenatal or postpartum smokers should be strongly discouraged. Much more public and private effort must be made to inform smoking mothers, in culturally competent ways, of the very significant risks of mixing bedsharing and smoking. Public health practitioners need to find new ways to inform mothers and providers that smoking mothers should not bedshare and that putting an infant of a nonsmoking mother to sleep in an adult bed should be delayed until 3 months of age.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Beds', 'Data Collection', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Care', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Prone Position', 'Risk Factors', 'Sleep', 'Smoking', 'Sudden Infant Death/etiology', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/adverse effects']",['Tobacco Smoke Pollution']

It is a 7beta-hydroxy epimer of the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). UDCA is isolated from the Chinese drug 'Yutan' a powder preparation derived from the dried bile of adult bears. For centuries, Yutan has been used in the treatment of hepatobiliary disorders. In Japan, it has also been in widespread use as a folk medicine from the mid-Edo period. In Japan, not only basic studies such as isolation, crystallization, definition of the chemical structure and establishment of the synthesis of UDCA have been conducted but clinical studies have been conducted. First reports on the effects of UDCA in patients with liver diseases came from Japan as early as 1961. In the 1970s, the first prospective study of patients with gallbladder stones treated with UDCA demonstrating gallstone dissolution was reported. In late 1980s, a number of controlled trials on the use of UDCA in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) were reported. Since then, a variety of clinical studies have shown the beneficial effect of UDCA in liver disease worldwide. To date, UDCA is utilized for the treatment of PBC for which it is the only drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In recent years, with the advent of molecular tools, the mechanisms of action of bile acids and UDCA have been investigated, and various bioactivities and pharmacological effects have been revealed. Based on the results of these studies, the bioactive substances in bile acids that are involved in digestive absorption may play important roles in signal transduction pathways. Furthermore, the mechanisms of action of UDCA is evidently involved. We reveal the physicochemical properties of UDCA as bile acid and overview the established pharmacological effects of UDCA from its metabolism. Furthermore, we overview the current investigations into the mechanism of action of UDCA in liver disease.""]",['eng'],,

But knowledge about the nature of this association, its main risk factors and how to improve health outcomes in lower social groups is still limited. Social class has been defined by different indicators by e.g. occupation and job position or the highest school qualification achieved. For international comparisons different classifications such as ""The Registrar General\'s Social Class Classification "" or the ""International Standard Classification of Education"" have been used. Several European Studies show a higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular risk factors including smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia in lower socioeconomic classes. But this studies also show that all socioeconomic groups have access to medical services. The Data from the Swiss Health Survey show the distribution of cardiovascular risk factors and diseases by three levels of education: Behaviouralfactors such as smoking, obesity and physical inactivity are more commonly present in the lower socioeconomic groups. People with a lower educational level visit their GP more often, whereas people with a higher level of educational consult specialists more frequently. Medical services are often used to check of blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol. An indication of state of health may be shown by medication and treatment for cardiovascular disease which is more prevalent in lower socioeconomic groups. The present discussion of explanations of the poorer state of health in lower socioeconomic groups goes beyond the classical risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Studies have shown that after the correction for risk factors a correlation remains between social class and state of health. It is believed, that psychosocial factors such as self-esteem, control in the workplace or coping-strategies play an additional important role in staying healthy. Therefore prevention of cardiovascular disease should not be restricted to minimisation of risk factors or to the measurement of certain blood-values and treatments. Efforts must also go into creating the conditions for a healthier life and promote possibilities for healthier behaviour in all socioeconomic classes.']",['ger'],"['Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/prevention & control', 'Educational Status', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Health Behavior', 'Health Promotion/methods', 'Humans', 'Patient Education as Topic/methods', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction Behavior', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",

One of the most feared complications is prosthetic joint infection, which is associated with significant morbidity and health care costs. The pathogenesis of prosthetic joint infections is influenced by microorganisms growing in biofilms, making these infections difficult to diagnose and eradicate. Low-grade infections are often manifest as early loosening with or without pain. They are therefore difficult to distinguish from aseptic failure. For an accurate diagnosis of prosthetic joint infections, a combination of preoperative and intraoperative tests is usually needed. Underlying rheumatologic disease can lead to periprosthetic inflammatory changes in tissue. Therefore, only the culture of the microorganism is definitive proof of infection. Successful treatment requires long-term antimicrobial therapy, ideally with an agent acting on adhering stationary-phase microorganisms, combined with an adequate surgical procedure.

Using a descriptive comparative design, the study took place at a not-for-profit, urban, continuing care retirement center (CCRC) with a 120-bed skilled nursing facility and a 34-unit assisted living facility. Sixty residents, 15 from each of the 3 skilled nursing units and assisted living unit, consented to participate. To understand the differences in the MDS and MMSE scores between units, a Level of Care Algorithm was constructed to analyze resident placement. Results revealed that MDS and MMSE scores placed greater than 75% of elders who had extremely poor cognitive or physical function but did not discriminate well for residents with moderate cognitive and/or physical impairment.

MEX is comprises four putative zinc-binding domains including an N-terminal SWIM (SWI2/SNF2 and MuDR) domain of unknown function and two RING (really interesting new gene) fingers separated by a ZZ zinc finger domain. Biochemical analyses revealed that MEX is self-ubiquitinated and targeted for degradation through the proteasome pathway. MEX can act as an E3, Ub (ubiquitin) ligase, through the E2, Ub-conjugating enzymes UbcH5a, UbcH5c or UbcH6. A region of MEX that contains the RING fingers and the ZZ zinc finger was required for interaction with UbcH5a and MEX self-association, whereas the SWIM domain was critical for MEX ubiquitination. The expression of MEX promoted apoptosis that was induced through Fas, DR (death receptor) 3 and DR4 signalling, but not that mediated by the BH3 (Bcl-2 homology 3)-only protein BimEL or the chemotherapeutic drug adriamycin. The enhancement of apoptosis by MEX required a functional SWIM domain, suggesting that MEX ubiquitination is critical for the enhancement of apoptosis.

This study provides a national perspective on medication delivery in AL settings from the perspectives of state Board of Nursing (BON) executives. Qualitative interviews using semi-structured interview guides were conducted with BON executives to validate a legal summary of AL regulations and nurse practice acts, and to identify nursing issues pertaining to medication management in AL across the United States. In this study, there was considerable variation across states regarding medication administration and the role of both the RN and the UAP. BON executives displayed a range of knowledge about nursing practice issues in AL, with many reporting low familiarity with this setting. Mechanisms for systematic review of quality of delegation were not in place. Medication administration and nurse delegation were dynamic issues, with practice and policy evolving concurrently.

The species dependence observed is consistent with phylogenetic relationships previously derived from plant morphological characteristics and from nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons of the two Rubisco subunits. Species dependence in the Rubisco-Rubisco activase interaction and the absence of major anomalies in the deduced amino acid sequence of tobacco Rubisco activase compared to sequences in non-Solanaceae species suggest that Rubisco and Rubisco activase may have coevolved such that amino acid changes that have arisen by evolutionary divergence in one of these enzymes through spontaneous mutation or selection pressure have led to compensatory changes in the other enzyme.']",['eng'],,

Based on these figures, the protein comprised approximately 2% by weight of soluble protein in spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) leaves. The preparations were at least 95% pure and were stable when frozen in liquid nitrogen. Addition of ATP during purification and storage was necessary to maintain activity. Assay of rubisco activase was based on its ability to promote activation of rubisco in the presence of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. There was an absolute requirement for ATP which could not be replaced by other nucleoside phosphates. The initial rate of increase of rubisco activity and the final rubisco specific activity achieved were both dependent on the concentration of rubisco activase. The initial rate was directly proportional to the rubisco activase concentration and was used as the basis of activity. The rate of activation of rubisco was also dependent on the rubisco concentration, suggesting that the activation process is a second order reaction dependent on the concentrations of both rubisco and rubisco activase. It is suggested that deactivation of rubisco occurs simultaneously with rubisco activase-mediated activation, and that rubisco activation state represents a dynamic equilibrium between these two processes.']",['eng'],,

Glycerate 3-phosphate (20 millomolar) slowed the initial rate but not the extent of activation and rubisco activase had no effect on this. The activation of rubisco was shown to be affected by phosphoenolpyruvate (3 millimolar) but not by creatine phosphate (3 millimolar) or ATP (3 millimolar), and the creatine-phosphate/creatine phosphokinase system was used to generate the high ATP/ADP quotients required for rubisco activase to function. ATP was shown to be required for the rubisco activase-dependent rubisco activation in the presence of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (1 millimolar).

In the presence of DCMU and methyl viologen, the artificial donors durohydroquinone and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) plus ascorbate both supported light activation of rubisco at saturating ATP concentrations. No light activation occurred when DCPIP was used as an acceptor with water as electron donor in the presence of ATP and dibromothymoquinone, even though photosynthetic electron transport was observed. Nigericin completely inhibited the light-dependent activation of rubisco. Based on these results, we conclude that stimulation of light activation of rubisco by rubisco activase requires electron transport through PSI but not PSII, and that this light requirement is not to supply the ATP needed by the rubisco activase reaction. Furthermore, a pH gradient across the thylakoid membrane appears necessary for maximum light activation of rubisco even when ATP is provided exogenously.']",['eng'],,

The effect of Rubisco activase on the dissociation kinetics of RuBP bound to this form of the enzyme was examined and characterized with the use of (3)H-labeled RuBP and proteins purified from spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) In the absence of Rubisco activase and in the presence of a large excess of unlabeled RuBP, the dissociation rate of bound [1-(3)H]RuBP was much faster after a short (30 second) incubation than after an extended incubation (1 hour). After 1 hour of incubation, the dissociation rate constant (K(off)) of the bound RuBP was 4.8 x 10(-4) per second, equal to a half-time of about 35 minutes, whereas the rate after only 30 seconds was too fast to be accurately measured. This time-dependent change in the dissociation rate was reflected in the subsequent activation kinetics of Rubisco in the presence of RuBP, CO(2), and Mg(2+), and in both the absence or presence of Rubisco activase. However, the activation of Rubisco also proceeded relatively rapidly without Rubisco activase if the RuBP level decreased below the estimated catalytic site concentration. High pH (pH 8.5) and the presence of Mg(2+) in the medium also enhanced the dissociation of the bound RuBP from Rubisco in the presence of RuBP. In the presence of Rubisco activase, Mg(2+), ATP (but not the nonhydrolyzable analog, adenosine-5'-O-[3-thiotriphosphate]), excess RuBP, and an ATP-regenerating system, the dissociation of [1-(3)H]RuBP from Rubisco was increased in proportion to the amount of Rubisco activase added. This result indicates that Rubisco activase-mediated hydrolysis of ATP is required for promotion of the enhanced dissociation of the bound RuBP from Rubisco. Furthermore, product analysis by ion-exchange chromatography demonstrated that the release of the bound RuBP, in an unchanged form, was considerably faster than the observed increase in Rubisco activity. Thus, RuBP dissociation was experimentally separated from activation and precedes the subsequent formation of active, carbamylated Rubisco during activation of Rubisco by Rubisco activase.""]",['eng'],,

Patients were also required to have 12 months of prostaglandin therapy subsequent to the initial prescription. Data were available through July 31, 2003. The t-test and chi-square were used where appropriate to calculate p-values and assess significant differences.!##!Results!#!A total of 13 171 benefit-eligible subjects were identified of which 8381 (64%), 2637 (20%), and 2153 (16%) patients were treated with latanoprost, bimatoprost, and travoprost, respectively. There were no significant differences in mean age or gender between the three study groups with the exception that latanoprost patients were statistically older than travoprost patients (69.0 vs. 68.0). This was not considered a clinically meaningful difference. Overall, patients using travoprost or bimatoprost had a significantly lower rate of adjunctive medication use compared to patients starting on latanoprost monotherapy (22.5%, 23.2%, and 30.2 %, respectively). Therefore, for every 14 patients treated with latanoprost instead of travoprost or bimatoprost, one additional patient would be expected to need adjunctive therapy with another agent. The difference between travoprost and bimatoprost patients was not significant.!##!Conclusions!#!The use of adjunctive medications to control intraocular pressure was significantly higher for latanoprost patients compared to travoprost and bimatoprost patients. This finding should be interpreted in the context that this study was based only on prescription claims data. It is important to simplify ophthalmic medical regimen as it is more cost effective, better for the patient, and minimizes the washout effect from administering two eye medications within 5 min. Decreasing the complexity of the patients' drug regimen may lead to increased adherence to prescribed therapy and a decreased risk of the incidence of blindness.""]",['eng'],"['Aged', 'Amides/therapeutic use', 'Bimatoprost', 'Cloprostenol/analogs & derivatives', 'Cloprostenol/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Glaucoma/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Intraocular Pressure/drug effects', 'Latanoprost', 'Lipids/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Prostaglandins F, Synthetic/therapeutic use', 'Prostaglandins, Synthetic/therapeutic use', 'Travoprost']","['Amides', 'Lipids', 'Prostaglandins F, Synthetic', 'Prostaglandins, Synthetic', 'Cloprostenol (4208238832)', 'Latanoprost (6Z5B6HVF6O)', 'Bimatoprost (QXS94885MZ)', 'Travoprost (WJ68R08KX9)']"

These cause stress for both patients and families. Although not all transitions during the end of life can be avoided, advance identification of those who could potentially experience numerous transitions may allow providers and caregivers to anticipate the problem and consider strategies to minimize their occurrence. This study examines the relationship between patient characteristics and the total number of transitions experienced by the patient from the date of admission to a palliative care program (PCP) to death and during final weeks of life.!##!Methods!#!Subjects included all adults registered with the PCP in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada between 1998 and 2002 and who had died during that period. Data was extracted from the regional PCP database and linked to census information. Transitions were defined as either: 1) a change in location of where the patient was cared for; or 2) a change in which service (specialist groupings, primary care, etc) provided care. Descriptive statistics were calculated plus rate ratios for the association between patient characteristics and total number of transitions.!##!Results!#!In total, 3972 patients made 5903 transitions during the study period. Although 28% experienced no transitions, over 40% experienced one and 6.3% five or more. At least one transition was made by 47% during the last four weeks of life. Adjusted results suggest women, the elderly and more recent death are associated with experiencing fewer transitions. Multiple transitions were associated with a hospital death and a cancer diagnosis. During the last month of life, age was no longer associated with the total number of transitions, cancer patients were found to experience a similar number or fewer transitions than patients with a non-cancer diagnosis and pain and symptom control become a significant factor associated with a greater number of transitions.!##!Conclusion!#!Our data suggest there is some variation in the number of transitions associated with the demographics and diagnoses of patients. Associations with gender and age require further exploration as does the contribution of caregiver supports and symptom issues.']",['eng'],,

Prereceptor metabolism of glucocorticoids by 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11beta-HSDs) modulates cellular steroid action. 11beta-HSD type 1 amplifies intracellular levels of active glucocorticoids in mice by reactivating corticosterone from inert 11-dehydrocorticosterone in cells expressing the enzyme. In this study we describe the rapid (within 3 h) induction of 11beta-HSD activity in cells elicited in the peritoneum by a single thioglycolate injection in mice. Levels remained high in peritoneal cells until resolution. In vitro experiments on mouse macrophages demonstrated that treatment with inert 11-dehydrocorticosterone for 24 h increased phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils to the same extent as corticosterone. This effect was dependent upon 11beta-HSD1, as 11beta-HSD1 mRNA, but not 11beta-HSD2 mRNA, was expressed in these cells; 11-dehydrocorticosterone was ineffective in promoting phagocytosis by Hsd11b1(-/-) macrophages, and carbenoxolone, an 11beta-HSD inhibitor, prevented the increase in phagocytosis elicited in wild-type macrophages by 11-dehydrocorticosterone. Importantly, as experimental peritonitis progressed, clearance of apoptotic neutrophils was delayed in Hsd11b1(-/-) mice. These data point to an early role for 11beta-HSD1 in promoting the rapid clearance of apoptotic cells during the resolution of inflammation and indicate a novel target for therapy.']",['eng'],"['11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1/biosynthesis', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1/deficiency', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1/genetics', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1/physiology', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 2/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Ascitic Fluid/enzymology', 'Ascitic Fluid/immunology', 'Ascitic Fluid/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Corticosterone/metabolism', 'Corticosterone/physiology', 'Humans', 'Macrophage Activation/genetics', 'Macrophage Activation/immunology', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/immunology', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Neutrophils/immunology', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Peritonitis/enzymology', 'Peritonitis/genetics', 'Peritonitis/immunology', 'Phagocytosis/genetics', 'Phagocytosis/immunology', 'Thioglycolates/administration & dosage', 'Up-Regulation/immunology']","['Thioglycolates', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 (EC 1.1.1.146)', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 2 (EC 1.1.1.146)', 'Corticosterone (W980KJ009P)']"

Asthma is the most common chronic condition in the UK. Previous research indicates that some asthma patients experience gaps in their NHS care. However, little attention has been given to how and why patients and parents of children with asthma use complementary therapies and the implications for NHS care.!##!Methods!#!Qualitative study, comprising 50 semi-structured interviews with a purposeful sample of 22 adults and 28 children with asthma (plus a parent), recruited from a range of NHS and non-NHS settings in Bristol, England. Data analysis was thematic, drawing on the principles of constant comparison.!##!Results!#!A range of complementary therapies were being used for asthma, most commonly Buteyko breathing and homeopathy. Most use took place outside of the NHS, comprising either self-treatment or consultation with private complementary therapists. Complementary therapies were usually used alongside not instead of conventional asthma treatment. A spectrum of complementary therapy users emerged, including ""committed"", ""pragmatic"" and ""last resort"" users. Motivating factors for complementary therapy use included concerns about conventional NHS care (""push factors"") and attractive aspects of complementary therapies (""pull factors""). While participants were often uncertain whether therapies had directly helped their asthma, breathing techniques such as the Buteyko Method were most notably reported to enhance symptom control and enable reduction in medication. Across the range of therapies, the process of seeking and using complementary therapies seemed to help patients in two broad ways: it empowered them to take greater personal control over their condition rather than feel dependant on medication, and enabled exploration of a broader range of possible causes of their asthma than commonly discussed within NHS settings.!##!Conclusion!#!Complementary therapy use reflects patients\' and parents\' underlying desire for greater self-care and need of opportunities to address some of their concerns regarding NHS asthma care. Self-management of chronic conditions is increasingly promoted within the NHS but with little attention to complementary therapy use as one strategy being used by patients and parents.

In this study, this behavior is investigated based on the kinetics of ionic diffusion. As a model ionic liquid, we chose butyldimethylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BDMIPF(6)). The common solvent was propylene carbonate (PC), and lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF(6)) was selected as the lithium conducting salt. Ionic diffusion coefficients are estimated by using a pulsed field gradient NMR technique. From a basic study on the model electrolytes (BDMIPF(6) in PC, LiPF(6) in PC, and BDMIPF(6) + LiPF(6) in PC), it was found that the BDMI(+) from BDMIPF(6) shows larger diffusion coefficients than the Li(+) from LiPF(6). However, the anionic (PF(6)(-)) diffusion coefficients present little difference between the model electrolytes. The higher diffusion coefficient of BDMI(+) than that of Li(+) suggests that the poor C-rate performance of lithium ion cells containing ionic liquids as an electrolyte component can be attributed to the two-cation competition between Li(+) and BDMI(+).']",['eng'],,

However, few studies compare IS(Ci) with ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) properties. Here, we assessed Rubisco activation state and in vitro Rubisco kinetics, the main determinants of IS(Ci), in spinach leaves grown at 30/25 [high temperature (HT)] and 15/10 degrees C [low temperature (LT)]. We measured Rubisco activation state and A at a CO2 concentration of 360 microL L(-1) (A360) at various temperatures. In both HT and LT leaves, the Rubisco activation state decreased with increasing temperatures above the optimum temperatures for A360, while the activation state remained high at lower temperatures. To compare Rubisco characteristics, temperature dependences of the maximum rate of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylation (Vcmax), specificity factor (Sc/o) and thermal stability were examined. We also examined Vcmax, and thermal stability in the leaves that were transferred from HT to LT conditions and were subsequently kept under LT conditions for 2 weeks (HL). Rubisco purified from HT, LT and HL leaves are called HT, LT and HL Rubisco, respectively. Thermal stabilities of LT and HL Rubisco were similar and lower than that of HT Rubisco. Both Vcmax and Sc/o in LT Rubisco were higher than those of HT Rubisco at low temperatures, while these were lower at high temperatures. Vcmax in HL Rubisco were similar to those of LT Rubisco at low temperatures, and to those of HT Rubisco at high temperatures. The predicted photosynthetic rates, taking account of the Rubisco kinetics and the Rubisco activation state, agreed well with A360 in both HT and LT leaves. This study suggests that photosynthetic performance is largely determined by the Rubisco kinetics at low temperature and by Rubisco Kinetics and the Rubisco activation state at high temperature.']",['eng'],"['Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Photosynthesis/physiology', 'Plant Leaves/enzymology', 'Plant Leaves/growth & development', 'Plant Leaves/physiology', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase/metabolism', 'Ribulosephosphates/metabolism', 'Spinacia oleracea/enzymology', 'Spinacia oleracea/growth & development', 'Spinacia oleracea/physiology', 'Temperature']","['Ribulosephosphates', 'ribulose-1,5 diphosphate (2002-28-0)', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.39)']"

In this article, we report on the neurobehavioral characteristics of children with FASD in selected communities in Italy. It was expected that both inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive characteristics would discriminate children with FASD from controls and that the groups would also differ on intellectual functioning, language comprehension, and academic skills.!##!Methods!#!Eighty-two children, 22 diagnosed with FASD and 60 control children, participated in this study. The children were administered tests of nonverbal reasoning, language comprehension, academic achievement, and behavior.!##!Results!#!On tests of nonverbal reasoning and language comprehension, the FASD group earned lower scores than did controls. Moreover, on a test of academic achievement the FASD group scored lower. When comparing these 2 groups on disruptive behavioral symptomatology, similar results were obtained, the FASD group showing greater attentional difficulties and hyperactivity/impulsivity behaviors and more overall behavioral problems. Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that a model containing inattention and error scores on the language comprehension task correctly classified 85% of the participants. Compared with the control group, a significantly greater proportion of children with FASD met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria of ADD, inattentive type, as reported by teachers. In contrast, hyperactive symptoms among children with FASD were comparable with the control group. Teachers rated children with FASD as having more inattentive behaviors and as performing lower in academic skills than controls. The association between reported hyperactivity symptoms and achievement scores was nonsignificant for both language and math scores, suggesting that it is not the hyperactivity causing problems, but the child's inattention.!##!Conclusions!#!This research indicates that a nonclinic-referred sample of Italian children with FASD display a profile of neurobehavioral functioning consistent with that reported by other researchers.

It could not only improve the light absorbance and the transformation from light energy to electron energy and to active chemical energy but also promote carbon dioxide (CO2) assimilation of spinach. However, the mechanism of carbon reaction promoted by nano-anatase TiO2 remains largely unclear. By electrophoresis and Western blot methods, the results of the experiments proved that Rubisco from the nano-anatase TiO2-treated spinach during the extraction procedure of Rubisco was found to consist of Rubisco and a heavier molecular-mass protein (about 1,200 kDa) comprising both Rubisco and Rubisco activase. The Rubisco carboxylase activity was 2.67 times that of Rubisco from the control and it could hydrolyze ATP in the same manner as Rubisco activase. The total sulfhydryl groups and available sulfhydryl groups of the Rubisco were 32 -SH and 21 -SH per mole of enzyme more than those of the Rubisco purified from the control, respectively. The circular dichroism spectra showed that the secondary structure of Rubisco from the nano-anatase TiO2-treated spinach was very different from Rubisco of the control.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate saccadic latency in young adults with dyslexia during the double-step paradigm, a task that requires rapid sequential visual information processing and saccade generation.

It catalyzes ubiquinone (UQ) reduction by ETF, linking oxidation of fatty acids and some amino acids to the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Deficiencies in ETF or ETF-QO result in multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, a human metabolic disease. Crystal structures of ETF-QO with and without bound UQ were determined, and they are essentially identical. The molecule forms a single structural domain. Three functional regions bind FAD, the 4Fe4S cluster, and UQ and are closely packed and share structural elements, resulting in no discrete structural domains. The UQ-binding pocket consists mainly of hydrophobic residues, and UQ binding differs from that of other UQ-binding proteins. ETF-QO is a monotopic integral membrane protein. The putative membrane-binding surface contains an alpha-helix and a beta-hairpin, forming a hydrophobic plateau. The UQ-flavin distance (8.5 A) is shorter than the UQ-cluster distance (18.8 A), and the very similar redox potentials of FAD and the cluster strongly suggest that the flavin, not the cluster, transfers electrons to UQ. Two possible electron transfer paths can be envisioned. First, electrons from the ETF flavin semiquinone may enter the ETF-QO flavin one by one, followed by rapid equilibration with the cluster. Alternatively, electrons may enter via the cluster, followed by equilibration between centers.

The absorption of CBD (a 250 microg/kg dose of CBD in all formulations) after sublingual administration of solid CBD/beta-CD complex and ethanolic CBD solution, and after oral administration of ethanolic CBD solution, was studied in vivo in rabbits. The dissolution rate of solid CBD/beta-CD complex in vitro was significantly (p<0.05) higher than that of plain CBD.

The polycomb repressive complex 2 complex possesses histone methyltransferase activity mediated by the Su(var)3-9, enhancer of zeste, and trithorax domain of EZH2, which methylates histone H3 on lysine (K)-27 (H3K27). In the present studies, we determined that treatment with the hydroxamate histone deacetylase inhibitor LBH589 or LAQ824 depleted the protein levels of EZH2, SUZ12, and EED in the cultured (K562, U937, and HL-60) and primary human acute leukemia cells. This was associated with decreased levels of trimethylated and dimethylated H3K27, with concomitant depletion of the homeobox domain containing HOXA9 and of MEIS1 transcription factors. Knockdown of EZH2 by EZH2 small interfering RNA also depleted SUZ12 and EED, inhibited histone methyltransferase activity, and reduced trimethylated and dimethylated H3K27 levels, with a concomitant loss of clonogenic survival of the cultured acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells. EZH2 small interfering RNA sensitized the AML cells to LBH589-mediated depletion of EZH2, SUZ12, and EED; loss of clonogenic survival; and LBH589-induced differentiation of the AML cells.

In vitro, the 11beta-HSD1 substrate, 11-dehydrocorticosterone, increased macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils to the same extent as corticosterone. This effect was dependent upon 11beta-HSD1: these cells solely expressed the type 1 11beta-HSD isozyme (not 11beta-HSD2), and carbenoxolone, an 11beta-HSD inhibitor, prevented the increase in phagocytosis elicited by 11-dehydrocorticosterone. Macrophages from 11beta-HSD1-deficient mice failed to respond to 11-dehydrocorticosterone. In vivo, 11beta-HSD1-deficient mice showed a delay in acquisition of macrophage phagocytic competence and had an increased number of free apoptotic neutrophils during sterile peritonitis. Importantly, in preliminary experiments, 11beta-HSD1-deficient mice exhibited delayed resolution of inflammation in experimental arthritis. These findings suggest 11beta-HSD1 may be a component of mechanisms engaged early during the inflammatory response that promote its subsequent resolution.']",['eng'],"['11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1/immunology', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1/metabolism', 'Acute-Phase Reaction/immunology', 'Animals', 'Glucocorticoids/immunology', 'Glucocorticoids/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/immunology', 'Inflammation/metabolism', 'Macrophages/immunology']","['Glucocorticoids', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 (EC 1.1.1.146)']"

Little has been published about who bedshares in the United States. This information would be useful to inform public policy, to guide clinical practice and to help focus research. The objective was to explore the prevalence and determinants of bedsharing in Oregon.!##!Methods!#!Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) surveys a population-based random sample of women after a live birth. Women were asked if they shared a bed with their infant ""always,"" ""almost always,"" ""sometimes"" or ""never.""!##!Results!#!1867 women completed the survey in 1998-99 (73.5% weighted response rate). Of the respondents, 20.5% reported bedsharing always, 14.7% almost always, 41.4% sometimes, and 23.4% never. In multivariable logistic regression, Hispanics (adjusted odds ratio [ORa] 1.69, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.17-2.43), blacks (ORa 3.11, 95% CI 2.03-4.76) and Asians/Pacific Islanders (ORa 2.14, 95% CI 1.51-3.03), women who breastfed more than 4 weeks (ORa 2.65, 95% CI 1.72-4.08), had annual family incomes less than $30,000 (ORa 2.44, 95% CI 1.44-4.15), or were single (ORa 1.55, 95% CI 1.03-2.35) were more likely to bedshare frequently (always or almost always).

Bedsharing black, American Indian/Alaska Native and white infants were much more likely to be exposed to smoking mothers than Hispanic or Asian/Pacific Islander infants (p < .0001).!##!Conclusions!#!Bedsharing is common in Oregon. The women most likely to bedshare are non-white, single, breastfeeding and low-income. Non-economic factors are also important, particularly among blacks and Hispanics.

Severe pulmonary intra-alveolar hemorrhage has been suggested as a potential marker for such differentiation. Our aims are to: (1) Compare pulmonary hemorrhage in SIDS and a control group comprised of infants whose deaths were attributed to accidental or inflicted suffocation. (2) Review individual cases with the most severe pulmonary hemorrhage regardless of the cause of death, and (3) Assess the effect of age, bedsharing, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and postmortem interval, with regard to the severity of pulmonary hemorrhage in SIDS cases. We conducted a retrospective study of all postneonatal cases accessioned by the Office of the Medical Examiner in San Diego County, California who died of SIDS or suffocation between 1999 and 2004. A total of 444 cases of sudden infant death caused by SIDS (405), accidental suffocation (36), and inflicted suffocation (3) from the San Diego SIDS/SUDC Research Project database were compared using a semiquantitative measure of pulmonary intra-alveolar hemorrhage [absent (0) to severe (4)]. Grades 3 or 4 pulmonary hemorrhage occurred in 33% of deaths attributed to suffocation, but in only 11% of the SIDS cases, however, all grades of pulmonary hemorrhage occurred in both groups. Therefore, our results indicate that the severity of pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be used in isolation to determine the cause or manner of sudden infant death. Among SIDS cases, those with a higher pulmonary hemorrhage grade (3 or 4) were more likely to bedshare, and with more than one co-sleeper, than those with a lower pulmonary hemorrhage grade (0 or 1). We conclude that each case must be evaluated on its own merits after thorough review of the medical history, circumstances of death, and postmortem findings.']",['eng'],"['Accidents, Home/statistics & numerical data', 'Asphyxia/pathology', 'Beds', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child Abuse/diagnosis', 'Epistaxis/pathology', 'Female', 'Forensic Pathology', 'Hemorrhage/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lung/pathology', 'Lung Diseases/pathology', 'Male', 'Pulmonary Alveoli/pathology', 'Purpura/pathology', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sleep', 'Sudden Infant Death/pathology']",

The antiserum against 11-dehydrocorticosterone 21-hemisuccinate-conjugated bovine serum albumin was raised in rabbits. As an enzyme-labeled antigen, 11-dehydrocorticosterone 21-hemisuccinate was conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Two ELISA systems were established: one without the extraction of steroids from serum (direct method), and another that used an HPLC purification step (HPLC method). The cross-reactivity of all steroids tested against the antibody was low except cortisone (92%); however, since cortisone levels in rats and mice are negligible, cortisone does not interfere with this direct ELISA. The measurable range of serum 11-dehydrocortiocosterone in both the direct and HPLC methods was 0.3-250 ng/ml and 0.78-400 ng/ml, respectively. Both methods displayed satisfactory parallel dilution, recovery and reproducibility; moreover, the values obtained with each method significantly correlated with the alternate method. To evaluate the two ELISA systems, the serum concentrations of 11-dehydrocorticosterone in normal rats and mice were determined by these two systems. The levels in Wistar rats fluctuated from 3 to 14 weeks of age (7.8+/-2.6 ng/ml) but at 1 week (1.7+/-1.2 ng/ml) were significantly low compared to other ages. No sex differences were found in rats and mice. Further, using the proposed direct method, chronological changes of rat serum 11-dehydrocorticosterone levels after 11-dehydrocorticosterone administration have been investigated together with corticosterone levels.

The results of cancer profiling indicated that its expression was suppressed in many cancers from different organs, implying a role in the neoplastic transformation of cells. Recently, we isolated JTB as a TGF-beta1-inducible clone by differential screening. In this study, we characterized its product and biological functions. We found that it was processed at the N-terminus and located mostly in mitochondria. When expressed in cells, JTB-induced clustering of mitochondria around the nuclear periphery and swelling of each mitochondrion. In those mitochondria, membrane potential, as monitored with a JC-1 probe, was significantly reduced. Coinciding with these changes in mitochondria, JTB retarded the growth of the cells and conferred resistance to TGF-beta1-induced apoptosis. These activities were dependent on the N-terminal processing and induced by wild-type JTB but not by a mutant resistant to cleavage. These findings raised the possibility that aberration of JTB in structure or expression induced neoplastic changes in cells through dysfunction of mitochondria leading to deregulated cell growth and/or death.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Death/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Epithelial Cells/physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interspersed Repetitive Sequences', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/cytology', 'Membrane Potentials/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/genetics', 'Mitochondria/physiology', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reference Values', 'Translocation, Genetic']","['RNA, Messenger']"

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia that is observed in clinical practice and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, resulting from stroke and exacerbation of heart failure. At present, there is a lack of pharmacologic agents that are able to safely and effectively convert the arrhythmia back to sinus rhythm. Vernakalant has the electrophysiologic properties of a multiple ion channel blocker, developed using a novel approach to target potassium channels that are selectively present in human atria rather than ventricles, and using a rate-dependent blocking strategy for its additional sodium channel block. This paper reviews the mechanism of action of this drug, its performance in preclinical models of efficacy and human disease, and its actions on patients in the completed and published preregistration clinical trials for vernakalant. Overall, vernakalant converted 51.5% of patients who had < 7 days duration of atrial fibrillation and it did this without significantly more cardiovascular adverse events than placebo. Therefore, it must be considered as an important new agent for the treatment of this growing health problem.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Anisoles/administration & dosage', 'Anisoles/chemistry', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents/administration & dosage', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents/chemistry', 'Atrial Fibrillation/drug therapy', 'Atrial Fibrillation/physiopathology', 'Drugs, Investigational/administration & dosage', 'Drugs, Investigational/chemistry', 'Heart Atria/drug effects', 'Heart Atria/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Pyrrolidines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrrolidines/chemistry']","['Anisoles', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Drugs, Investigational', 'Pyrrolidines', 'vernakalant (9G468C8B13)']"

However, the significance of glucocorticoid metabolism in specific kidney regions in vivo is not clear, possibly in part due to the difficulty in measuring glucocorticoid levels in kidney regions in vivo. We used microdialysis techniques to sample renal interstitial fluid from conscious rats. The levels of corticosterone (active) and 11-dehydrocorticosterone (inactive) were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Direct infusion of the 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11beta-HSD) inhibitor carbenoxolone into the renal medulla induced hypertension, and significantly increased corticosterone levels and the corticosterone/11-dehydrocorticosterone ratio, an index of 11beta-HSD activity, in the renal medullary microdialysate, but not in urine or the plasma. Further characterization of conscious, untreated rats (n = 13-16) indicated that corticosterone concentrations (ng/ml) were 0.8 +/- 0.1, 1.0 +/- 0.1, 66.7 +/- 8.1, and 7.9 +/- 1.1 in cortical microdialysate, medullary microdialysate, the plasma, and urine, respectively. The corticosterone/11-dehydrocorticosterone ratios were 0.8 +/- 0.1, 0.6 +/- 0.1, 10.6 +/- 1.4, and 1.7 +/- 0.1, respectively, in these 4 types of sample. The expression level of 11beta-HSD1 was higher in the medulla than in the cortex, whereas 11beta-HSD2 was most enriched in the outer medulla. Microdialysate levels of corticosterone were approximately 1.6-fold higher in afternoons than in mornings, whereas plasma levels differed by 2.8-fold. These results demonstrated that corticosterone excess in the renal medulla might be sufficient to cause hypertension and provided the first characterization of renal interstitial glucocorticoids.']",['eng'],"['11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Blood Pressure/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carbenoxolone/pharmacology', 'Circadian Rhythm/physiology', 'Corticosterone/analogs & derivatives', 'Corticosterone/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Kidney Medulla/drug effects', 'Kidney Medulla/enzymology', 'Male', 'Microdialysis', 'Potassium/urine', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sodium/urine', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']","['Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Sodium (9NEZ333N27)', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.146)', '11-dehydrocorticosterone (FO4V44A3G3)', 'Carbenoxolone (MM6384NG73)', 'Potassium (RWP5GA015D)', 'Corticosterone (W980KJ009P)']"

Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) typically present with a large intrapulmonary shunt, which makes even high F(IO(2)) ineffective in improving P(aO(2)). PEEP decreases intrapulmonary shunt by recruiting collapsed alveoli, but PEEP is associated with important adverse effects, whereas prolonged exposure to high F(IO(2)) may cause oxidative lung injury. The improved survival found in the National Institutes of Health's ARDS Network low-tidal-volume study may suggest that their PEEP/F(IO(2)) titration tables represent the best method for adjusting these variables. Based upon an extensive literature review of PEEP and respiratory system mechanics in ARDS, we conclude that: (1) for most patients the therapeutic range of PEEP is relatively narrow, so the ARDS Network PEEP/F(IO(2)) strategy is reasonable and supported by high-level evidence, (2) how best to adjust PEEP to prevent or ameliorate ventilator-associated lung injury is unknown and still under investigation, and (3) in a small subset of patients with severe lung injury and/or abnormal chest-wall compliance, highly individualized titration of PEEP, based upon the respiratory-system pressure-volume curve, PEEP/tidal-volume titration grids, or a recruitment maneuver and a PEEP decrement trial is a reasonable alternative.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Humans', 'National Institutes of Health (U.S.)', 'Positive-Pressure Respiration', 'Pulmonary Atelectasis/prevention & control', 'Pulmonary Gas Exchange', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult/therapy', 'Respiratory Mechanics', 'United States']",

Hygienic measures have not only to be taken in ambulant treatment but also in households of affected patients.']",['ger'],"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Toxins/metabolism', 'Community-Acquired Infections/diagnosis', 'Community-Acquired Infections/drug therapy', 'Community-Acquired Infections/transmission', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Exotoxins/metabolism', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Leukocidins/metabolism', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Pneumonia, Staphylococcal/diagnosis', 'Pneumonia, Staphylococcal/drug therapy', 'Pneumonia, Staphylococcal/transmission', 'Soft Tissue Infections/diagnosis', 'Soft Tissue Infections/drug therapy', 'Soft Tissue Infections/transmission', 'Staphylococcal Skin Infections/diagnosis', 'Staphylococcal Skin Infections/drug therapy', 'Staphylococcal Skin Infections/transmission', 'Staphylococcus aureus/pathogenicity']","['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Exotoxins', 'Leukocidins', 'Panton-Valentine leukocidin']"
M17534195,['Higher risk of failure of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus prosthetic joint infections.'],"['We determined the effect of methicillin resistance on the outcome of patients with Staphylococcus aureus prosthetic joint infections. From January 1995 to December 2004, 33% of 137 episodes of prosthetic joint infections were the result of S. aureus (in monomicrobial or polymicrobial cultures). Thirty-three (24%) episodes among 31 patients were the result of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and 12 (9%) episodes among 12 patients were the result of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Overall treatment failure rate was 38%. Patients with methicillin-susceptible S. aureus or methicillin-resistant S. aureus prosthetic joint infections did not differ in age, gender, comorbidities, joint age, prior surgical procedures performed on the affected joint, number of postsurgical medical complications, or duration of intravenous antimicrobial therapy. Patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus prosthetic joint infection had longer hospital durations (median, 15 versus 10 days). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus in periprosthetic tissue culture resulted in a higher risk of treatment failure (hazard ratio, 9.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.40-35.46) than methicillin-susceptible S. aureus when controlling for joint location (total knee arthroplasty versus total hip arthroplasty [hazard ratio, 5.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.52-22.19]) and removal of hardware (hazard ratio, 0.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.077-0.75). Efforts should be made to prevent methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections of joint arthroplasties and develop new treatment modalities.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Hip Prosthesis/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Knee Prosthesis/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Methicillin Resistance', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prosthesis-Related Infections/microbiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Staphylococcus aureus/drug effects', 'Treatment Failure']",

When an endometrioma is diagnosed, it is indicated to remove endometrial cysts by laparoscopy or perform an aspiration before the cycle of IVF.!##!Objectives!#!To evaluate the effect of endometriosis diagnosed incidentally during oocyte retrieval on the IVF outcome, as well as to establish its frequency.!##!Material and methods!#!Retrospective analysis of 1,000 files of patients who underwent to oocyte retrieval between January 2002 and March 2005, in the Centro Especializado para la Atenci6n de la Mujer in Mexico City. Of the total procedures tubal factor was the first indication for IVF and male factor was on second place. Only in seven patients of 1,000 oocyte retrievals was detected the presence of endometriosis fluid instead of folicular fluid.!##!Results!#!The prevalence of endometriosis diagnosed incidentally during oocyte retrieval was 0.7%, and the oocyte quality was 1.55 (regular). The fertilization rate for patients with endometriomas was 45% and the implantation and pregnancy rates were zero per cent while the patients without endometriomas the fertilization rate was 65% with an implantation rate of 18% and the pregnancy rate was 35%.!##!Conclusion!#!Endometriosis is a disease that must be treated before an IVF cycle in stages III-IV and especially in presence of endometriomas because it could affect negatively IVF outcomes.']",['spa'],"['Adult', 'Endometriosis/diagnosis', 'Endometriosis/epidemiology', 'Endometriosis/surgery', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Gynecologic Surgical Procedures', 'Humans', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Oocyte Donation', 'Pregnancy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",
