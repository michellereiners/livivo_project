M7857456,"['Licensed midwife-attended, out-of-hospital births in Washington state: are they safe?']","['The safety of out-of-hospital births attended by midwives who are licensed according to international standards has not been established in the United States. To address this issue, outcomes of births attended out of hospital by licensed midwives in Washington state were compared with those attended by physicians and certified nurse-midwives in hospital and certified nurse-midwives out of hospital between 1981 and 1990. Outcomes measured included low birthweight, low five-minute Apgar scores, and neonatal and postneonatal mortality. Associations between attendant and outcomes were measured using odds ratios to estimate relative risks. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression controlled for confounding variables. Overall, births attended by licensed midwives out of hospital had a significantly lower risk for low birthweight than those attended in hospital by certified nurse-midwives, but no significant differences were found between licensed midwives and any of the comparison groups on any other outcomes measured. When the analysis was limited to low-risk women, certified nurse-midwives were no more likely to deliver low-birthweight infants than were licensed midwives, but births attended by physicians had a higher risk of low birthweight. The results of this study indicate that in Washington state the practice of licensed nonnurse-midwives, whose training meets standards set by international professional organizations, may be as safe as that of physicians in hospital and certified nurse-midwives in and out of hospital.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Certification', 'Female', 'Home Childbirth/standards', 'Home Childbirth/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Licensure, Nursing', 'Logistic Models', 'Nurse Midwives/standards', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome/epidemiology', 'Washington/epidemiology']",
M7865258,['Factors adversely associated with breast feeding in New Zealand.'],"[""Control data from 1529 infants studied in a multicentre case-control study of sudden infant death in New Zealand were analysed to identify factors that might hinder the establishment and duration of breast feeding. Although 1300 infants (85%) were exclusively breast-fed at discharge from the obstetric hospital, this fell to 940 (61%) by 4 weeks. Logistic regression was used to identify factors that might adversely influence breast feeding 'at discharge', 'at 4 weeks' and the overall 'duration' of breast feeding. When adjusted for confounding factors, not exclusive breast feeding 'at discharge' was significantly associated with: twin pregnancy, being a Pacific Islander, mother not bedsharing, subsequent dummy use, birthweight less than 2500 g, heavy maternal smoking, not attending antenatal classes and mother less than 20 years old at first pregnancy. Mothers smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day were nearly twice as likely to not exclusively breast feed on discharge compared to those who did not smoke. A 'dose response' was apparent with the heaviest smokers having the least likelihood of establishing exclusive breast feeding. Being exclusively breast-fed at discharge but not 'at 4 weeks' was associated with: twin pregnancy, admission to a neonatal intensive care unit, subsequent dummy use and not being married. A shorter overall 'duration' of breast feeding was associated with maternal smoking, subsequent dummy use, mother not bedsharing, twin pregnancy, mother less than 20 years old at first pregnancy, low occupational status and not attending antenatal classes. These effects persisted when social and demographic factors, including birthweight, were taken into account.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)""]",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Breast Feeding', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'New Zealand', 'Patient Discharge', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/adverse effects', 'Time Factors']",

In this study, subcellular fractionation was used to demonstrate that FasD is an outer membrane protein. In addition, the accessibility of FasD to proteases established the presence of surface-exposed FasD domains on both sides of the outer membrane. The fasD gene was sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence was shown to share homologous domains with a family of outer membrane proteins from various fimbrial systems. Similar to porins, fimbrial outer membrane proteins are relatively polar, lack typical hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains, and posses secondary structures predicted to be rich in turns and amphipathic beta-sheets. On the basis of the experimental data and structural predictions, FasD is postulated to consist essentially of surface-exposed turns and loops and membrane-spanning interacting amphipathic beta-strands. In an attempt to test this prediction, the fasD gene was submitted to random in-frame linker insertion mutagenesis. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that it was possible to produce fasD mutants, whose products remain functional for fimbrial export and assembly. Subsequently, 11 fasD alleles, containing linker inserts encoding beta-turn-inducing residues, were shown to express functional proteins. The insertion sites were designated permissive sites. The inserts used are expected to be least detrimental to the function of FasD when they are inserted into surface-exposed domains not directly involved in fimbrial export. In contrast, FasD is not expected to accommodate such residues in its amphipathic beta-strands without being destabilized in the membrane and losing function. All permissive sites were sequenced and shown to be located in or one residue away from predicted turns. In contrast, 5 of 10 sequenced nonpermissive sites were mapped to predicted amphipathic beta-strands. These results are consistent with the structural predictions for FasD.']",['eng'],"['Adhesins, Escherichia coli', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Bacterial/genetics', 'Antigens, Surface/genetics', 'Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins/classification', 'Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Fractionation', 'DNA Transposable Elements/genetics', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Fimbriae Proteins', 'Fimbriae, Bacterial', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']","['Adhesins, Escherichia coli', 'Antigens, Bacterial', 'Antigens, Surface', 'Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'antigen 987P, E coli', 'Fimbriae Proteins (147680-16-8)']"

Corticosterone receptors have been found in the cortical collecting tubule, and at least four metabolites of the hormone have been identified in rat renal tissue and urine. The biologic activity of these metabolites is not completely known. In this study, we examined the functional effects of three of the metabolites of corticosterone on membrane transport in toad and turtle bladders; we also analyzed the oxidoreductase pathways for corticosterone metabolism. In the toad bladder, maximal water flow (vasopressin- and cyclic AMP-stimulated) was unaffected by corticosterone, 11-dehydro-20-dihydrocorticosterone (metabolite I) and 11-dehydrocorticosterone (metabolite IV); maximal water flow was significantly inhibited by 20-dihydrocorticosterone (metabolite II). Sodium transport in the toad bladder was stimulated by corticosterone, 11-dehydrocorticosterone and 20-dihydrocorticosterone. Analysis of the oxidoreductase pathways in this tissue revealed that most of the corticosterone was oxidized to 11-dehydrocorticosterone, a biologically active compound; 11-dehydrocorticosterone was further metabolized to 11-dehydro-20-dihydrocorticosterone, a biologically inactive compound. Only 6% of the parent compound was converted to 20-dihydrocorticosterone. In the turtle bladder, none of the metabolites tested altered hydrogen ion secretion over the time period studied; no significant biotransformation of corticosterone occurred in this tissue. As the metabolites of corticosterone found in toad bladder are the same as those identified in mammalian tissues, our studies suggest that some of them may be important modulators of sodium and water transport in the distal nephron. Our data further suggest that these compounds are likely not involved in the regulation of urinary acidification.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Biological Transport/physiology', 'Biotransformation/physiology', 'Bufo marinus/metabolism', 'Corticosterone/analogs & derivatives', 'Corticosterone/pharmacokinetics', 'Corticosterone/pharmacology', 'Membranes/metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Sodium/pharmacokinetics', 'Species Specificity', 'Turtles/metabolism', 'Urinary Bladder/metabolism']","['20-dihydrocorticosterone (35531-74-9)', 'Sodium (9NEZ333N27)', '11-dehydrocorticosterone (FO4V44A3G3)', 'Corticosterone (W980KJ009P)']"

During the period the ECMO centre was contacted in 10 instances. The referring department indicated the ECMO centre correctly in six instances. However, at least in two instances too late and the patients died (during priming of the ECMO circuit or transport could not be implemented because of the critical condition). In two instances, however, the ECMO staff failed as it was unable to ensure a minimum of seven days of safe operation of ECMO and therefore ECMO was not provided. Based on this experience the authors present an organizational model of the ECMO unit which is formed ad hoc when needed and comprises specialists of various professions from the sphere of emergency medicine. The main purpose of the present paper is to inform referring departments on the indications, selection criteria, contraindications of ECMO in neonates and children and to ensure thus not only smooth communication between the ECMO centre and the referring department but in the first place early referral to the ECMO centre at a time when transport is not yet a problem.']",['cze'],"['Adult', 'Child', 'Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation', 'Facility Design and Construction', 'Health Facility Administration', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn']",

Essential role of the phosphodiesterase catalytic core.'],"['Phosphodiesterase (PDE) in bovine retinal rod outer segments is activated when it forms a membrane-bound complex with the alpha-subunit of transducin loaded with GTP (T alpha*). At maximal activation, this complex contains two T alpha* and all the subunits of native PDE (PDE alpha, PDE beta, and two inhibitory PDE gamma). We observed previously (Pagès, F., Deterre, P., and Pfister, C. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 22018-22021) that the rate of GTP hydrolysis by transducin in a rod outer segment suspension is enhanced when T alpha* is bound to native PDE (PDE alpha beta gamma 2). In this article, we compare the effects of PDE species with different PDE gamma contents. We show that T alpha* hydrolyzes its GTP faster not only when bound to PDE alpha beta gamma 2, but also when bound to PDE alpha beta gamma or PDE alpha beta. Moreover, trypsin-treated PDE (PDE gamma-deprived soluble PDE) also induces an acceleration of GTP hydrolysis. On the contrary, addition of isolated PDE gamma alone does not accelerate GTP hydrolysis. The interaction between T alpha* and PDE gamma, which is essential for the activation of PDE by T alpha*, is apparently not responsible of the feedback of PDE on T alpha*. The interaction of primary importance for the acceleration of GTP hydrolysis would be that existing between T alpha* and PDE alpha beta.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Catalysis', 'Cattle', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Hydrolysis', 'Kinetics', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Retinal Rod Photoreceptor Cells/metabolism', 'Transducin/metabolism']","['Membrane Proteins', 'Guanosine Triphosphate (86-01-1)', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases (EC 3.1.4.-)', 'Transducin (EC 3.6.5.1)']"

This cesarean reduction involved no compromise in mortality and morbidity outcome measures. Moreover, groups of women at elevated risk for adverse perinatal outcomes have attained excellent outcomes and cesarean rates well below the general population rate with these care arrangements. How do midwives and out-of-hospital birth settings so effectively help women to avoid unnecessary cesareans? This paper explores this question by presenting data from interviews with midwives who work in home settings. The midwives' understanding of and approaches to major medical indications for cesarean birth contrast strikingly with prevailing medical knowledge and practice. From the midwives' perspective, many women receive cesareans due to pseudo-problems, to problems that might easily be prevented, or to problems that might be addressed through less drastic measures. Policy reports addressing the problem of unnecessary cesarean births in the U.S. have failed to highlight the substantial reduction in such births that may be expected to accompany greatly expanded use of midwives and out-of-hospital birth settings. The present study--together with cohort studies documenting such a reduction, studies showing other benefits of such forms of care, and the increasing reluctance of physicians to provide obstetrical services--suggests that childbearing families would realize many benefits from greatly expanded use of midwives and out-of-hospital birth settings.""]",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Cesarean Section/statistics & numerical data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Misuse/statistics & numerical data', 'Home Childbirth/methods', 'Humans', 'Matched-Pair Analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Nurse Midwives/education', 'Nurse Midwives/psychology', 'Obstetrics', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'United States']",

Seven liver function tests (AST, ALT, ALP, LAP, GTP, Ch-E and T-cholest) were assessed monthly. The values were compared before and after the administration of UDCA. The AST, ALT, LAP and GTP improved significantly in the UDCA treated patients, whereas ALP, Ch-E and T-cholest. did not show any change throughout the study. Amongst the liver function tests that improved, the serum--GTP level, in particular decreased markedly and rapidly in patients treated with UDCA. Although UDCA 600-mg daily was administered in patients who showed lack of improvement with 300-mg UDCA treatment, no significant improvement was obtained. Repeated liver biopsies were carried out in six of the 42 patients in whom liver biopsy had been performed before the administration of UDCA. We detected no histological changes during the UDCA treatment. There were no side effects related to therapy with UDCA.

The authors of the present study noted that respiratory frequency did not increase in the earlier experiment and wondered whether respiratory stimulation occurred during acetazolamide administration, as would be expected if CO2 level increases significantly.!##!Method!#!Ten patients with panic disorder and six normal control subjects received injections of acetazolamide, 1 g i.v., as per the Mathew et al. protocol, during breath by breath measurement of both tidal volume and frequency of respiration.!##!Results!#!Three patients had panic attacks, one before receiving acetazolamide, one during the injection, and one 2 minutes after injection.

The analysis is applicable to museum or field-weathered specimens and also to the damage, such as single-strand nicks, which can occur during storage. Two main results are derived: (i) oligonucleotide priming competes extremely effectively against regeneration derived from priming by overlaps of damaged DNA strands. (ii) Extending result (i), it is shown that jumping PCR is not likely to cause inaccurate sequence determination in standard PCR protocols. One exception arises where it is required to determine the sequence of one specified variant of a piece of DNA which is present in many thousand copies. But, generally, experiments can be performed with confidence that the results are very rarely distorted by jumping PCR. The basic model is extended to investigate how to increase the average length of DNA fragments input to PCR experiments. Increased input of less-damaged material to the PCR can theoretically be achieved by performing several cycles of denaturation, re-association and replication on the sample DNA in the absence of exogenous primers. Experimental work will be necessary to confirm this. However, jumping PCR may occur at substantial frequencies during such pretreatment. This problem cannot be avoided but can be reduced in pretreatment protocols by studying sequences (such as mtDNA or rDNA) where multiple copies are subjected to evolutionary homogenizing processes.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Gene Amplification/genetics', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Models, Genetic', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",

It has been proposed that aldosterone selectivity in vivo is achieved by the conversion of corticosterone into its inactive metabolite 11-dehydrocorticosterone by 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta HSD). To test this hypothesis, we transfected rat liver 11 beta HSD cDNA into TBM cells, a sodium-transporting cell line. These cells respond equally well to aldosterone and corticosterone, indicating that endogenous 11 beta HSD is expressed at low levels in TBM cells. Although exogenous rat liver 11 beta HSD was expressed at high levels in transfected cells, mineralocorticoid selectivity was not observed. By contrast, the biologically inactive 11-dehydrocorticosterone was readily converted into corticosterone, a potent agonist for sodium transport. Our results indicate that rat liver 11 beta HSD behaves predominantly as a reductase in TBM cells. Another 11 beta HSD isoform is likely to be responsible for the dehydrogenase reaction in aldosterone-responsive cells.']",['eng'],"['11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Corticosterone/analogs & derivatives', 'Corticosterone/metabolism', 'Corticosterone/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Epithelium/enzymology', 'Epithelium/physiology', 'Female', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/genetics', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Plasmids', 'Rats', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Urinary Bladder/drug effects', 'Urinary Bladder/enzymology']","['Dexamethasone (7S5I7G3JQL)', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.-)', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.146)', '11-dehydrocorticosterone (FO4V44A3G3)', 'Corticosterone (W980KJ009P)']"

The lateral abdominal muscles, the diaphragm and the pelvic floor are all components of this fasciomuscular support system. Voluntary and reflective changes in muscle tension allow the entry and exit of matter into and out of the spherical abdominal cavity by opening and closing of specialized wall segments called sphincters. We have previously demonstrated the existence of a resting tone in the tail muscles of mammals from which the human pelvic floor muscles are derived. The pelvic floor and its integrated sphincters form the anorectal organ of continence. This organ is much weaker in females than in males. The spinal centers that govern continence, contain in the female significantly fewer ganglion cells than the corresponding centers in the male. Childbirth and a commonly found tendency to develop constipation are additional stressors for the congenitally weaker female organ of continence. We explain in this paper why the abdominal wall and the pelvic floor may suffer stretch-induced denervation injuries during pregnancy and delivery. Such damage may persist in later life and can give rise to incontinence and ""flabby abdomen"". Based on our work in this field, we found a new differentiation between continent and incontinent constipation. Continent constipation is caused by spasticity of the pelvic floor characterized by abnormally high sphincter activity. This spastic pelvic floor syndrome can be treated successfully by psychotherapeutic techniques. Incontinent constipation, in contrast, is always associated with subnormal activity of the sphincters and may be a cause of rectal prolapse. It can be treated successfully by anterior rectosigmoid resection. Incontinent constipation will also require operative approximation of the levators in many cases. Improvement cannot be expected to result from this procedure, however, unless the pelvic floor shows some residual resting activity.']",['ger'],"['Abdominal Muscles/innervation', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cesarean Section', 'Fecal Incontinence/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle Denervation', 'Muscle Hypotonia/physiopathology', 'Muscle Tonus/physiology', 'Muscular Atrophy/physiopathology', 'Neuromuscular Junction/physiopathology', 'Peritoneal Cavity/innervation', 'Pregnancy/physiology']",

Since epithelial cells derived from the toad bladder also contain this enzyme, we wished to further characterize its properties in prepared cell homogenates. 11 beta-OHSD from toad bladder demonstrated a clear preference for NAD+ over NADP+ as a cofactor similar to that observed in renal cortical collecting duct (CCD) cells. Furthermore, 11 beta-OHSD had a rapid onset of action. The apparent Km for corticosterone was 16.3 x 10(-8) M, a value comparable to that observed for enzyme from CCD, and a Vmax of 4.8 x 10(-12) mol.mg protein-1.min-1. The end product, 11-dehydrocorticosterone (compound A), influenced enzyme activity; it increased 11 beta-OHSD activity at corticosterone concentrations below the apparent Km for the enzyme and inhibited 11 beta-OHSD activity at corticosterone concentrations above the Km for the enzyme. The inhibitory effects of compound A appeared noncompetitive with an apparent equilibrium constant (Ki) of 2.8 x 10(-7) M. Consistent with its inhibitory action on 11 beta-OHSD, compound A (10(-6) M) enhanced the short-circuit current response to corticosterone (10(-7) M) in the intact toad bladder (experimental 2.03 +/- 0.33 vs. control 1.40 +/- 0.17 times above baseline; n = 7, P < 0.01).

Of the four mutants obtained, Y147S and Y147A exhibited very low ubihydroquinone:cyt c reductase activities and were unable to support photosynthetic growth (Ps) while Y147F and Y147V were Ps+.

Already since the foundation of the first nursing school, teaching aimed at developing the student to dispense nursing care necessary for the patient's assistance. When the nurse started to perform their activities in nosocomial and community institutions, the need for someone who would be responsible for the organization, coordination and control of nursing personnel and the Nursing Unit itself, in short, someone who would head the services became apparent. At present, the professional role of the nurse is changing regarding his/her overall assistance to the patient, caring directly, determining and/or carrying out nursing assistance necessary for the patient's health, maintenance or recovery. In this manner, it is necessary for nurses to use tools of administration science such as planning, decision making, and planned changes in order to be able to provide the nursing assistance with quality. Thus, this study aims at helping the development of the nurse's interest in computer during the teaching-learning process, motivating the search for knowledge in computerized sources. We intended to offer the opportunity for discussion and reflection on problems of nosocomial nursing practice, favoring interchange of theory and practice. The system is being developing using ToolBook Live Software to be run in Windows environment.

Two isoforms exist: 11 beta-HSD1, a bidirectional NADPH-dependent enzyme, and 11 beta-HSD2, an NAD(+)-dependent exclusive 11 beta-dehydrogenase (corticosterone-inactivating enzyme). In this study, 11 beta-HSD1 activity and mRNA synthesis were demonstrated in primary fetal hippocampal cell cultures. Unexpectedly, the reaction direction in intact hippocampal cells was 11 beta-reduction (reactivation of inert 11-dehydrocorticosterone), although homogenization revealed that the enzyme was capable of 11 beta-dehydrogenation when removed from its normal cellular context. Dexamethasone (10(-7) M) increased 11 beta-HSD activity in homogenates of hippocampal cultures (102% increase). In intact hippocampal cells, dexamethasone induced 11 beta reductase, not dehydrogenase. To determine the functional relevance of hippocampal 11 beta-reductase, glucocorticoid potentiation of kainic acid neurotoxicity was examined. Pretreatment of hippocampal cells with corticosterone reduced survival on kainate exposure. Hippocampal cell 11 beta-HSD activity was potently inhibited by carbenoxolone. Carbenoxolone had no effect on cell survival after kainate alone and did not alter the effect of corticosterone. 11-Dehydrocorticosterone also potentiated kainate neurotoxicity; this effect was lost, however, if 11 beta-HSD was inhibited with carbenoxolone. Thus, hippocampal 11 beta-HSD seems to be a functional 11 beta-reductase in intact cells. Measures to attenuate hippocampal 11 beta-reductase may reduce neuronal vulnerability to glucocorticoid toxicity.']",['eng'],"['11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured/enzymology', 'Corticosterone/analogs & derivatives', 'Corticosterone/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Hippocampus/cytology', 'Hippocampus/enzymology', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/metabolism', 'Kainic Acid/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neurons/cytology', 'Neurons/enzymology', 'Neurotoxins/metabolism', 'Rats']","['Glucocorticoids', 'Neurotoxins', 'Dexamethasone (7S5I7G3JQL)', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.-)', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.146)', '11-dehydrocorticosterone (FO4V44A3G3)', 'Kainic Acid (SIV03811UC)', 'Corticosterone (W980KJ009P)']"

In contrast, picornavirus and some specialized mRNAS initiate translation by internally binding ribosomes. A poorly described third mechanism of initiation, referred to as ribosome shunting or jumping, involves discontinuous scanning by 40S ribosome subunits, in which large segments of the 5' noncoding region are bypassed. Ribosome shunting has only been observed to date on a cauliflower mosaic virus mRNA. In this report we show that the family of adenovirus late mRNAs, which are preferentially translated during infection, use a ribosome jumping mechanism to initiate protein synthesis. Late adenovirus mRNAs contain a common 5'-noncoding region known as the tripartite leader, which confers preferential translation by reducing the requirement for the rate-limiting initiation factor eIF-4F (cap-binding protein complex). Adenovirus inhibits cell protein synthesis largely by inactivating eIF-4F. We show that the tripartite leader directs both 5' linear ribosome scanning and ribosome jumping when eIF-4F is abundant but exclusively uses a ribosome jumping mechanism during late adenovirus infection or heat shock (stress) of mammalian cells, when eIF-4F is altered or inactivated. Shunting is directed by a complex group of secondary structures in the tripartite leader and is facilitated by one or more unidentified viral late gene products. We propose that shunting may represent a widespread mechanism to facilitate selective translation of specialized classes of capped mRNAs, including some stress and developmentally regulated mRNAs, which possess little requirement for eIF-4F but do not initiate by internal ribosome binding.""]",['eng'],"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line/virology', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F', 'Genes, Viral', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational', 'Peptide Initiation Factors/genetics', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Ribosomes/genetics', 'Viral Structural Proteins/genetics']","['Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F', 'Peptide Initiation Factors', 'Viral Structural Proteins']"

Today, dentists bond materials not only to enamel, but also to dentine. Up until recently, the clinical success with dentine bonding agents had been unreliable at best, and many clinicians had become sceptical as to whether it would ever be possible to bond to dentine. In this paper, some of the important break-throughs in the field of dentinal adhesives are reviewed in an attempt to throw some light on the question, does resin based dentine bonding work? The technical procedure used to optimise dentine bonding is reviewed, emphasising the significance of etching dentine, placing the primer on a slightly moist dentine surface, avoiding oxygen inhibition of the bonding resin, and maximising the degree of cure. In addition, emphasis is also placed on the significance of variations in dentine structure, and how sclerotic dentine may make dentine bonding less efficient. The conclusion of the entire review is that although significant improvements have been made in the field of dentine bonding during the last few years, it is still too early to conclude that dentine bonding will survive several years of clinical service.']",['eng'],"['Acid Etching, Dental', 'Adhesives/chemistry', 'Calcinosis/pathology', 'Dental Bonding', 'Dental Enamel/ultrastructure', 'Dentin/ultrastructure', 'Dentin, Secondary/pathology', 'Dentin-Bonding Agents/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Resins, Synthetic/chemistry']","['Adhesives', 'Dentin-Bonding Agents', 'Resins, Synthetic']"

Where the enzyme 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase converting corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone is absent (cytosol preparations), [3H]corticosterone binds to classical glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors; in whole cells when 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is blocked by carbenoxolone, cytoplasmic and nuclear binding of authentic [3H]corticosterone rises. Saturation and Scatchard analyses of nuclear [3H]11-dehydrocorticosterone binding demonstrate a single saturable binding site with a dissociation constant of < or = 10 nM at 22 C.

A total of 2067 elderly persons were then screened with a vernacular adaptation of the MMSE. All those who scored 23 and below had a detailed neuropsychological evaluation by CAMDEX-Section B, and the care-givers of the people with confirmed cognitive impairment were interviewed using CAMDEX-Section H to confirm the history of deterioration or impairment in social or personal functioning. In the third phase the subjects with confirmed cognitive impairment were evaluated at home as to whether they satisfied the DSM-III-R criteria for dementia. Subcategorisation of dementia was done based on ICD-10 diagnostic criteria. Five percent of those whose screening was negative were randomly selected and evaluated during each stage.!##!Results!#!Sixty-six cases of dementia were identified from 2067 persons aged 60 and above, a prevalence rate of 31.9 per thousand. After correction this rate was 33.9 per thousand. Fifty-eight percent of the dementia cases were diagnosed as vascular dementia and 41% satisfied the criteria for ICD-10 dementia in Alzheimer's disease.

Observing that some patients evaluated for suspected hypersomnolence complain of insomnia and others fail to report that they are sleepy, we wondered whether overestimation of sleep latency could be occurring in these subjects as well. Since polysomnography (PSG) only provides one sleep onset with which to assess a patient's estimation, we investigated the use of the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) for this purpose. Among 147 patients who had an MSLT, 137 of whom had a preceding PSG, overestimation of sleep latency occurred on 78% and 74% of the respective tests. The magnitude of overestimation averaged 3 minutes and 27 minutes, respectively, and was not dependent on diagnosis. Subjects who had reported a history of difficulty falling asleep, compared to those who did not, tended to show equivalent objective sleep latencies, longer subjective nocturnal sleep latencies and less overall accuracy in their estimates. Those who denied having a problem with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) showed objective sleep latencies nearly identical to those who complained of EDS but had only a trend toward higher overestimation on the MSLT. Overestimation of sleep latency is therefore more readily part of an explanation for why hypersomnolent patients sometimes complain of insomnia than it is for failure to recognize EDS. The MSLT as well as nocturnal recordings can provide data with which to assess overestimation of sleep latency.""]",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Narcolepsy/diagnosis', 'Polysomnography', 'Sex Factors', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes/diagnosis', 'Time Factors']",

Patients were randomly assigned to use either the new flossing device or finger flossing first in the sequence. At baseline, data were collected and patients were given flossing method instructions. The Silness & Löe GI, Quigley-Hein PI, Eastman Bleeding Index (BI) and trauma were assessed at baseline, 15 and 30 days for each treatment period. After the initial 30-day treatment phase, patients were instructed to cease all flossing during a 14-day ""washout"" period. Subjects were then assigned to the opposite treatment group during the 2nd treatment phase. A 3-factor repeated measures ANOVA analyzed data for differences within and between groups over time. Results revealed statistically significant (p < 0.01) within group improvement in PI, GI, and BI for both treatment groups over time. No statistically significant between group differences were found for either group at any time period. In addition, no significant gingival trauma was recorded and no differences were found between groups. Quik Floss was as effective as finger flossing. Subjects preferred (55%) Quik Floss over finger flossing. In conclusion, Quik Floss is a safe and effective oral hygiene measure for reducing plaque, inflammation and bleeding over time.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Dental Devices, Home Care', 'Dental Plaque/prevention & control', 'Dental Plaque/therapy', 'Dental Plaque Index', 'Equipment Design', 'Female', 'Gingiva/injuries', 'Gingival Hemorrhage/prevention & control', 'Gingivitis/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oral Hygiene/instrumentation', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Periodontal Index', 'Safety']",

Both behavior-specific variables, such as perceived benefits and costs of flossing, and general variables, such as gender, were included as predictors. Canonical correlation analysis indicated three equations were needed to predict the three oral health behaviors. Flossing frequency, for example, was best predicted by confidence in flossing ability and beliefs about the benefits of and barriers to flossing.

Rheumatoid arthritis and the occurrence of a major nonprosthetic infection (sepsis) were found to be highly associated with the development of a second prosthetic infection (P < .001 and P = .0001, respectively). In those rheumatoid patients with multiple infections, there was a significantly larger proportion with American Rheumatism Association class III and IV function than those with a single prosthetic infection (P = .0002). In 14 of the 27 cases of more than one prosthetic infection, the infected implants presented clinically within the same month. Ten of these 14 had an associated nonprosthetic infection.

These are caused by a decrease of bone mass and deterioration of bone structure leading to loss of strength. Treatment of osteoporosis should result in an increase of bone mass, and the incidence of new vertebral fractures should diminish. However, new vertebral fractures are not always accompanied by pain, and disability does not well correlate with the number of vertebral fractures. Patients with osteoporosis often have other problems e.g. with taking a shower, preparing meals, gardening, walking stairs, visiting friends and attending social activities. In addition, pain and disability may influence mood and lead to depression. The assessment of quality of life should be a primary endpoint in clinical trials in patients with osteoporosis and in individual patients care. Recently, the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (EFFO) has decided a develop a questionnaire for patients with vertebral osteoporosis, i.e. patients with vertebral deformities. The questionnaire is meant for use in clinical trials. A questionnaire was made including 48 questions and 6 visual analogue scales. The questions concern the following domains: pain, activities of daily living, jobs around the house, moving, leisure and social activities, general health perception and mood.

Because environmental or caretaking factors have been shown to exert powerful effects on susceptibility to SIDS, manipulations that facilitate arousability might be protective against SIDS. All-night laboratory polysomnographic recordings were performed in 20 routinely bedsharing and 15 routinely solitary sleeping healthy breast-feeding Latino infants within the peak age range for SIDS, in both bedsharing (with mother) and solitary sleeping environments. The most important findings revealed by repeated measures analyses of variance were a significant reduction in stage 3/4 sleep and an inverse increase in stage 1/2 sleep on the bedsharing night compared to the solitary night, irrespective of routine sleeping arrangement. Shorter mean duration episodes of stage 3/4 sleep and longer mean stage 1/2 sleep episodes accounted for these differences. Because the arousal threshold is high in the electroencephalographic delta range, by limiting the amount of stage 3/4 sleep, bedsharing should promote infant arousability and might be protective against SIDS. The results also suggest that accepted normative values for infant sleep established in solitary sleeping infants may not be representative of infants raised in social sleeping environments.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Arousal/physiology', 'Beds', 'Humans', 'Infant Care', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Mother-Child Relations', 'Polysomnography', 'Posture/physiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sleep Stages/physiology', 'Sleep, REM/physiology', 'Sudden Infant Death/etiology']",

Six routinely bedsharing and six routinely solitary-sleeping pairs slept 3 nights in the sleep laboratory. The first night matched the routine home condition, followed by 1 bedsharing night and 1 solitary-sleeping night in random order. During bedsharing infants were never placed prone, regardless of their routine sleeping condition. On the bedsharing night, mothers and infants spent most of the night oriented toward each other; seven of 12 infants remained oriented toward their mothers the entire night. While sleeping in a face-to-face orientation, most pairs slept most of the time less than 30 cm apart with appreciable amounts of time at less than 20 cm. This orientation and proximity should facilitate sensory exchanges between mother and infant which, we hypothesize, influence the infant's sleep physiology and nocturnal behavior. We conclude that bedsharing minimizes the use of the prone infant sleeping position, probably in part to facilitate breast feeding. By promoting nonprone positions, bedsharing may protect some infants from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), since prone sleeping is a known risk factor for SIDS. The large percentage of the night that mothers spent oriented toward their infants suggests that a higher degree of maternal vigilance may also result from bedsharing.""]",['eng'],"['Breast Feeding', 'California', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Care', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Mother-Child Relations', 'Orientation', 'Posture/physiology', 'Prone Position/physiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sleep/physiology', 'Sudden Infant Death/prevention & control', 'United States']",

A belief that bedsharing with infants negatively impacts the quality of adult sleep also appears wide-spread. This has not been substantiated, however, because the few studies that have measured the impact of bedsharing on adult sleep examined only bedsharing with another adult. In the present study, laboratory polysomnography was performed in 20 routinely bedsharing and 15 routinely solitary-sleeping, breastfeeding, Latino mother-infant pairs comparing the mothers' sleep when bedsharing to solitary-sleeping nights. Infants were 11-15 weeks old at the time. Irrespective of routine sleeping arrangement, mothers' total sleep time was not decreased on the bedsharing night compared to the solitary night. Across the two groups, percent Stage 3-4 sleep (of total sleep time) was significantly reduced on the bedsharing night but only by 3.9%, while Stage 1-2 sleep was increased 3.7%. Episodes of both Stages 3-4 and 1-2 were significantly shorter. The amount of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was unaffected. Overall, arousal frequency was significantly increased by 3.6 hour-1. As the increase in arousal frequency was stage specific, it could account for the pattern of stage changes. Nocturnal wakefulness was not increased, however, because awakenings were of shorter duration. these effects of bedsharing did not habituate with routine bedsharing because they were not diminished in the routinely bedsharing mothers compared to the routinely solitary-sleeping mothers. We find that the impact of bedsharing on maternal sleep is modest and somewhat different from the reported impact of sleeping with another adult. From the infant's standpoint, the effects on maternal sleep are adaptive to the extent that opportunities to monitor the infant's status are enhanced. The mother's caregiver role is likely germane to differential effects on sleep of bedsharing with an infant versus another adult.""]",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Arousal', 'Beds', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mother-Child Relations', 'Mothers', 'Sleep Stages', 'Sleep, REM']",

M9261495,['Maternal proximity and infant CO2 environment during bedsharing and possible implications for SIDS research.'],"[""Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the leading cause of human infant mortality after the neonatal period in Western countries. Recently, child care practices have been shown to be important in determining infant vulnerability to SIDS. However, very little is known about the impact of parent-infant cosleeping on infant sleep physiology and behavior and SIDS risk. This reflects the failure of Western societal research paradigms to appreciate the human infant's evolutionary history of cosleeping, the recency of the emergence of solitary infant sleeping as a practice and the fact that parent-infant cosleeping is still the preferred sleeping arrangement for the majority of contemporary societies. Incorporating current hypotheses on the mechanisms of SIDS, we have hypothesized that the comparatively sensory-rich cosleeping environment might be protective against SIDS in some contexts. As a first step to characterize cosleeping environments, this investigation is aimed at assessing, in routinely bedsharing mothers and infants, their relative sleeping positions and the potential for sleeping in close face-to face proximity and for infant exposure to increased environmental CO2 produced by maternal respiration. The latter is important in that breathing elevated levels of CO2 can have diverse effects, ranging from respiratory stimulation at low levels to suffocation at very high levels. Two related laboratory studies were performed. In the first, all-night videotapes of 12 healthy, routinely bedsharing mother-infant pairs were analyzed for sleeping positions and time spent in face-to-face orientation and distances separating their faces. Infants were 11-15 wk old. Mothers predominantly positioned themselves on their sides facing their infants, with the infants placed either supine or on their sides. Mothers and infants slept oriented face-to-face for 64 +/- 27% (S.D.) of non-movement time, with distance less than 20 cm commonly separating their faces. In the second study, concentrations of CO2 in air were measured in six young women at distances of up to 21 cm from their nares. Peak expiratory CO2 concentrations remained above 1.0% at distances up to 9 cm and above 0.5% at 18 cm. Both baseline and peak CO2 levels were further increased at all distances when measured within a partial air pocket created to simulate a bedding environment sometimes seen during bedsharing. We conclude that during bedsharing there is potential for 1) a high degree of face-to-face orientation and close proximity and consequently 2) increased environmental CO2, as a result of maternal respiration, to non-lethal levels that might stimulate infant respiration. The close proximity would also maximize the sensory impact of the mother on the infant through other modalities. We also suggest that bedsharing may minimize prone infant positioning, a known risk factor for SIDS.""]",['eng'],"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Breast Feeding', 'California', 'Carbon Dioxide/analysis', 'Carbon Dioxide/metabolism', 'Environment', 'Female', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Posture/physiology', 'Research', 'Respiration/physiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sleep/physiology', 'Sudden Infant Death/epidemiology', 'Sudden Infant Death/etiology', 'Videotape Recording']",['Carbon Dioxide (142M471B3J)']

A standardized test evaluated resident pediatric critical care knowledge before and after the pediatric ICU rotation. Number and type of resident procedures were documented. Four-point Likert scale questionnaires were used to evaluate resident educational satisfaction and resident performance. Opportunity cost, the graduate medical education return on educational investment, the critical care attending physician\'s return on resident investment, and the optimal teaching time for number of rotation residents were calculated. Unit demographics were documented. Data analysis included multivariate analysis, t-test, and chi-squared techniques. Significance was defined as p < .05, rotated factor loading > 0.5, and Eigenvalues > or = 1. Kmeans identified clusters. From September 1994 to May 1996, 71 residents, 34 (48%) from pediatric or medicine-pediatric programs and 37 (52%) from emergency medicine residency programs, participated in our second-year pediatric ICU resident educational process. All residents showed improvement between pretest and posttest knowledge scores (p < .05). Seventy percent of the variance in critical care attending physician evaluations of the residents during their pediatric ICU rotation was based on bedside clinical skills (31%), communication skills (20%), and basic knowledge base (19%). Critical care attending physician evaluations of residents placed residents into three clusters: ""hands-on,"" ""well-rounded,"" or ""book-heavy"" residents. Prerotation test scores, postrotation test scores, and numbers of procedures performed did not correlate with how critical care attending physicians evaluated overall performances of individual residents. Three factors explained 61% of the variances in resident satisfaction with the pediatric ICU rotation: clinical experience (27%), formal didactics (18%), and text availability (16%). Resident educational satisfaction did not appear to depend on access to procedures. Critical care attending physicians spent a minimum of 12.6 hrs/wk involved in resident education. The opportunity cost for using critical care attending physicians to provide 12.6 resident teaching hours per week was calculated as $111,384/yr. Pediatric ICU patient demographics, morbidity, and mortality did not change during the introduction of the resident educational program in the pediatric ICU.!##!Conclusions!#!During a required pediatric ICU resident rotation, balancing the resident\'s educational and decision-making autonomy needs and the critical care attending physician\'s desire to provide consistent bedside care of the critically ill child is an ongoing interactive process that requires substantial personnel, time, and financial commitments. It is possible to maintain patient care in the pediatric ICU and provide residents with a satisfying pediatric ICU experience. Trends in financial reimbursement may limit our present time commitment to the resident pediatric ICU curriculum.']",['eng'],"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness/therapy', 'Curriculum', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intensive Care Units, Pediatric', 'Internship and Residency/economics', 'Pediatrics/education']",

We have tested the hypothesis of whether the infants who had received NIDCAP would show advanced sleep-wake pattern, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental outcome.!##!Methods!#!Thirty-five VLBW infants were randomly assigned to receive NIDCAP or routine infant care. The goals for NIDCAP intervention were to enhance comfort and stability and to reduce stress and agitation for the preterm infants by: a) altering the environment by decreasing excess light and noise in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and by using covers over the incubators and cribs; b) use of positioning aids such as boundary supports, nests, and buntings to promote a balance of flexion and extension postures; c) modification of direct hands-on caregiving to maximize preparation of infants for, tolerance of, and facilitation of recovery from interventions; d) promotion of self-regulatory behaviors such as holding on, grasping, and sucking; e) attention to the readiness for and the ability to take oral feedings; and f) involving parents in the care of their infants as much as possible. The infants' sleep was recorded at 36 weeks postconceptional age (PCA) and at 3 months corrected age (CA) using the Motility Monitoring System (MMS), an automated, nonintrusive procedure for determining sleep state from movement and respiration patterns. Behavioral and developmental outcome was assessed by the Neurobehavioral Assessment of the Preterm Infant (NAPI) at 36 weeks PCA, the APIB at 42 weeks PCA, and by the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) at 4, 12, and 24 months CA.!##!Results!#!Sleep developmental measures at 3 months CA showed a clear developmental change compared with 36 weeks PCA. These include: increased amount of quiet sleep, reduced active sleep and indeterminate sleep, decreased arousal, and transitions during sleep. Longest sleep period at night showed a clear developmental effect (increased) when comparing nighttime sleep pattern of infants at 3 months with those at 36 weeks of age. Day-night rhythm of sleep-wake increased significantly from 36 weeks PCA to 3 months CA. However, neither of these sleep developmental changes showed any significant effects of NIDCAP intervention. Although all APIB measures showed better organized behavior in NIDCAP patients, neither NAPI nor Bayley showed any developmental advantages for the intervention group. The neurodevelopmental outcome measured by the Bayley at 4, 12, and 24 months CA showed 64% of the NIDCAP intervention group at the lowest possible score compared with 33% of the control group. These findings could not be explained by the occurrence of intraventricular hemorrhage or the socioeconomic status of the parents, which showed no significant group effect.!##!Conclusion!#!The results of this study, including measures of sleep maturation and neurodevelopmental outcome up to 2 years of age did not demonstrate that the NIDCAP intervention results in increased maturity or development. Buehler et al (Pediatrics. 1995;96:923-932) have reported that premature infants (N = 12; mean gestational age 32 weeks, mean birth weight 1700 g) who received developmental care compared with a similar group of infants who received routine care showed better organized behavioral performance on an APIB assessment at 42 weeks PCA. None of the medical outcome measures were significantly different in this study. Although our APIB results are in agreement, the results of the NAPI, the Bayley and sleep measures do not show an increase in neurodevelopmental maturation.

The recent findings underline the importance of this enzyme in excluding glucocorticoids from mineralocorticoid receptors. In the present study, 11betaHSD activity was compared in the intestine of herbivorous (guinea pig), omnivorous (rat), and granivorous (hen) animals, i.e., in animals in which the Na+ transport either is or is not regulated by aldosterone under normal conditions and in which the plasma levels of individual glucocorticoids are different. Slices of various intestinal segments were incubated in the presence of corticosterone or 11-dehydrocorticosterone, and the steroids were extracted and analyzed by HPLC. In the mammalian intestine, the activity of 11betaHSD was very low (approaching zero) in aldosterone-insensitive segments (duodenum, jejunum) but significant activity was revealed in aldosterone-sensitive segments (ileum, cecum, and proximal and distal colon). In comparison with the rat, the guinea pig large intestine exhibited significantly higher activity of 11betaHSD. There was no detectable reductase activity (conversion of 11-dehydrocorticosterone to corticosterone) in any intestinal segments of either species. Unexpectedly, no 11betaHSD activity was observed in the avian intestine. It was found that, in contrast to the mammalian intestine, corticosterone was metabolized to 20-dihydrocorticosterone while 11-dehydrocorticosterone was converted to 11-dehydro-20-dihydrocorticosterone. The distribution of 20-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20HSD) activity in the avian intestine was homogenous along the intestine and did not correlate with the mineralocorticoid sensitivity of intestinal segments. To trace different cosubstrate dependence of 11betaHSD and 20HSD, homogenates of ileum and distal colon were incubated with NAD+/NADH or NADP+/NADPH, respectively. In accordance with slice experiments mammalian intestine displayed only oxidation of corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone and NAD+ preference. In avian intestine, the metabolite formed from corticosterone was 11-dehydrocorticosterone in the presence of NAD+ or NADP+ whereas in the presence of NADPH 11-dehydro-20-dihydrocorticosterone and 20-dihydrocorticosterone were formed. Given the wide similarity between mineralocorticoid regulation of epithelial transport in mammals and birds, the unexpected finding of differences in the metabolism of corticosterone suggests that role of 20HSD is to allow aldosterone occupancy of mineralocorticoid receptors.']",['eng'],"['11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases', 'Animals', 'Biotransformation', 'Chickens', 'Corticosterone/analogs & derivatives', 'Corticosterone/metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/enzymology', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Female', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/metabolism', 'Intestinal Mucosa/enzymology', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Species Specificity', 'Subcellular Fractions/enzymology', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism']","['Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.-)', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.146)', '11-dehydrocorticosterone (FO4V44A3G3)', 'Corticosterone (W980KJ009P)']"

From the review of the literature it can be concluded that the mechanisms of bonding to dentine are still not fully understood. The more recently introduced materials use mechanical means of adhesion where the dentine is altered by primers or conditioners to expose collagen fibres and a hybrid zone is created by the penetration of unfilled resins into this fibrous network. The irritant effects of a bonding agent on pulpal tissue may be caused by bacterial ingrowth due to initial poor bonding or a breakdown of the bond in addition to any inherent toxicity of the constituents of the bonding agent.']",['eng'],"['Bicuspid/drug effects', 'Bicuspid/ultrastructure', 'Biocompatible Materials/pharmacology', 'Dental Bonding', 'Dental Restoration, Permanent/methods', 'Dentin/drug effects', 'Dentin/ultrastructure', 'Dentin-Bonding Agents/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Smear Layer']","['Biocompatible Materials', 'Dentin-Bonding Agents']"

Data from a survey of 41142, 12-16-year-old children from 244 secondary schools throughout England were analysed to obtain information about flossing frequency, dental attendance and recalled advice about flossing, and some general cleanliness and social behaviours. Subjects completed a questionnaire, anonymously, in class during normal school hours. Flossing frequency was found to change with age, its use becoming less frequent from age 12 through age 16 years. There was a significant relationship between flossing frequency and the time since the last dental attendance, the more recent attenders flossing more frequently. 6% of subjects recalled receiving advice about flossing at their last dental attendance and higher proportions of those who used floss recalled such advice, compared with non-flossers. Flossing frequency was also found to correlate positively with frequencies of washing hands after visiting the lavatory and bathing, and having a current friend of the opposite gender. There was only a small association between smoking habit and flossing, and only in school years 8 and 10: subjects most committed to smoking used floss slightly more frequently than those who did not smoke. Factor analysis showed evidence of gender differences in perceptions of flossing. Males equated use of floss with health-related behaviours while females associated flossing more with cleanliness behaviours. This finding is consistent with gender differences in toothbrushing behaviour reported in previous studies. The present study provides further insights into the history of dental flossing.']",['eng'],"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Baths/statistics & numerical data', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Dental Care/statistics & numerical data', 'Dental Devices, Home Care/statistics & numerical data', 'England', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Female', 'Hand Disinfection', 'Health Behavior', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oral Hygiene/instrumentation', 'Oral Hygiene/psychology', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Behavior', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",

The forum provided an assessment of the evidence for recommendations to reduce the risk of SIDS using an evidence-based process. Strong evidence has now accumulated that the intervention campaigns to reduce prone sleeping during infancy have been followed by SIDS rate declines. Recent data indicate that the supine position is not associated with an increase in significant morbidity outcomes and provides greater protection for SIDS than the side position, which may be unstable. Covering of the baby's head by bedding is strongly related to SIDS. The infant's sleeping environment should be carefully set up to ensure that the baby's head, including the face, cannot be obstructed during sleep. Parental smoking is strongly associated with SIDS. Structural supportive interventions for parental smoking cessation are required. Bedsharing increases the risk of SIDS amongst smokers and the data are currently not sufficient to provide complete reassurance to nonsmoking parents that bedsharing is safe. Infants should be maintained in a comfortable temperature zone. The evidence for a protective effect of breast-feeding is conflicting, so breast-feeding cannot be promoted strongly as reducing the risk of SIDS. Immunisation has not been associated with SIDS. Parents and carers should be aware of the current guidelines. Health professionals should also be aware of the evidence on which the current recommendations are based. Effective health education programmes should lead to a further decline in SIDS mortality in Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Australia', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Risk Factors', 'Sudden Infant Death/etiology', 'Sudden Infant Death/prevention & control']",

Most described specific events that forced them into the nursing home environment. Health needs, specifically the need for 24-hour care or supervision, emerged as the dominant factor for remaining in the nursing home. Of the 12 elders interviewed, all demonstrated some evidence of cognitive impairment. This study suggests that there are persons in nursing facilities today for whom community-based services, such as affordable assisted-living, would be reasonable and appropriate.

We studied the clinicopathologic features of 54 cases of PNF for which the hematoxylin- and eosin-stained slides and paraffin blocks were available and adequate clinical follow-up could be obtained. In addition, in all cases, a representative section of the PNF and, when present, MPNST, was evaluated immunohistochemically with an antibody for p53 (DO7). The cohort included 28 male patients and 26 female patients, with an age range from 4 to 79 years (mean, 27 yr). Of these 54 patients, 46 (85%) met the strict diagnostic criteria for NF1. Thirty-nine patients had PNF alone; 15 patients had an MPNST arising from the PNF (PNF/MPNST). Those patients with PNF/MPNST tended to be older (38 yr vs. 22 yr) and to have larger tumors (10.5 cm mean vs. 7.4 cm mean) than those with PNF alone. In 9 patients (23%) of 39 with PNF alone, local recurrence developed, whereas in 7 patients (47%) of 15 with PNF/MPNST, recurrent MPNST developed, and metastases developed in 3 (20%) of the 15. Immunohistochemically, only 1 case (2.5%) of 39 cases of PNF alone stained for p53. On the other hand, 12 (80%) of 15 cases of PNF/MPNST showed p53 immunoreactivity in the MPNST component, 2 of which also showed staining in the PNF areas. In conclusion, we found that the vast majority of patients with PNF met the strict diagnostic criteria for NF1. The immunohistochemical detection of intranuclear p53 protein is common in the malignant areas of PNF/MPNST but is rare in the PNF regions. The rarity of p53 staining in the PNF regions precludes its use in predicting those tumors that are likely to progress to MPNST.']",['eng'],"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nerve Sheath Neoplasms/chemistry', 'Nerve Sheath Neoplasms/complications', 'Nerve Sheath Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Nerve Sheath Neoplasms/pathology', 'Neurofibroma, Plexiform/chemistry', 'Neurofibroma, Plexiform/complications', 'Neurofibroma, Plexiform/epidemiology', 'Neurofibroma, Plexiform/pathology', 'Peripheral Nervous System Neoplasms/chemistry', 'Peripheral Nervous System Neoplasms/complications', 'Peripheral Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Peripheral Nervous System Neoplasms/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis']",['Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']

It has already been reported that beef heart submitochondrial particles under such conditions exhibit an EPR-detectable semiquinone, which is distinct from Q-i and which was attributed to a semiquinone in the Qo site (de Vries, S., Albracht, S. P. J., Berden, J. A., and Slater, E. C. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 11996-11998). However, we show here that this signal, which can be generated to a level of around 0.1 per bc1 monomer, is insensitive to the Qo site inhibitors myxothiazol, E-beta-methoxyacrylate-stilbene, and stigmatellin, indicating that it does not arise from a Q-o species. Based on sensitivities to inhibitors of other Q sites, up to 60% of the signal may arise from semiquinones of complexes I and II. We further show that the iron-sulfur center remains EPR silent under oxidant-induced reduction conditions. Overall, the results indicate that, under conditions of oxidant-induced reduction, the Qo site is occupied primarily by quinol with the iron-sulfur center oxidized, or, possibly, by an antiferromagnetically coupled semiquinone/reduced iron-sulfur center pair, which are EPR silent. This is discussed in relation to proposed mechanisms of quinol oxidation in the Qo site, and we describe a minimal intermediate-controlled bifurcation model based on rate constants by which bifurcated electron transfer at the Qo site might occur.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Antimycin A/pharmacology', 'Benzoquinones/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Electron Transport Complex III/metabolism', 'Hydroquinones/metabolism', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondria, Heart/metabolism', 'Models, Chemical', 'Oxidation-Reduction']","['Benzoquinones', 'Hydroquinones', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins', 'semiquinone radicals (3225-29-4)', 'Antimycin A (642-15-9)', 'Electron Transport Complex III (EC 1.10.2.2)']"

As one of the mechanisms by which UDCA improves liver function tests in those patients, its immunomodulatory effect is currently considered important. Although the suppressive effects of UDCA on some cytokine productions, T-cell mediated cytotoxicity and immunoglobulin production were observed from in vitro studies, the immunomodulation in vivo by UDCA remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effect of UDCA administration on the number of immunoglobulin secreting cells in liver, peripheral blood, spleen and Peyer's patches in mice using the enzyme linked immunospot assay and assessed whether the UDCA-mediated immunomodulation is liver-specific. It was demonstrated that intragastric administration of UDCA reduced immunoglobulin secretion by lymphocytes from liver, but not from peripheral blood, spleen, or Peyer's patches. However, immunoglobulin production of those lymphocytes cultured in the presence of UDCA was suppressed, irrespective of their distribution sites, in a UDCA dose-dependent manner. When the concentrations of UDCA in portal and peripheral blood were measured using high performance liquid chromatography, UDCA was detectable in the portal blood in UDCA-treated mice, but not in peripheral blood, suggesting that the concentrations of UDCA in the environment surrounding lymphocytes may be an important factor for the modulation of lymphocyte functions.""]",['eng'],"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/blood', 'Adjuvants, Immunologic/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Immunoglobulins/biosynthesis', 'Liver/cytology', 'Liver/drug effects', 'Liver/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', ""Peyer's Patches/cytology"", ""Peyer's Patches/drug effects"", ""Peyer's Patches/immunology"", 'Spleen/cytology', 'Spleen/drug effects', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Ursodeoxycholic Acid/blood', 'Ursodeoxycholic Acid/pharmacology']","['Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Ursodeoxycholic Acid (724L30Y2QR)']"

Several authors have described conditions which, they believe, render patients with prosthetic joints more at risk for infection. Prosthetic joint patients with these ""high risk"" conditions have the same types of infecting organisms as other patients with PJI. This indicates that the infecting bacteria are from wound contamination or distant sites of infection and not related to dental procedure bacteremias. Based on this review, antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated for patients with prosthetic joints when receiving invasive dental procedures, since there is no proven benefit and there are known risks involved with the use of antibiotics. However, the American Dental Association (ADA) and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), in an advisory statement, suggest prophylaxis for ""high risk"" patients. The ADA and AAOS recommend a single dose of amoxicillin, cephradine, or clindamycin when prophylaxis is selected.

In tissue homogenates, 11beta-HSD type 1 (11beta-HSD-1) exhibits both 11beta-dehydrogenase (corticosterone inactivating) and 11beta-reductase (corticosterone regenerating) activities, whereas 11beta-HSD type 2 (11beta-HSD-2) is an exclusive dehydrogenase. In the rat testis, 11beta-HSD has been proposed to reduce glucocorticoid inhibition of testosterone production, promoting puberty and fertility. This hypothesis presupposes dehydrogenation predominates. 11beta-HSD-1 immunoreactivity has been localised to Leydig cells. However, recent studies suggest that 11beta-HSD-1 is predominantly an 11beta-reductase in many intact cells. We therefore examined the expression and reaction direction of 11beta-HSD isozymes in cultures of intact rat Leydig cells. Reverse transcriptase PCR demonstrated expression of 11beta-HSD-1, but not 11beta-HSD-2 mRNA in rat testis. Primary cultures of intact rat Leydig cells showed predominant 11beta-reductase activity, activating 50-70% of 11-dehydrocorticosterone to corticosterone over 3 h, whereas 11beta-dehydrogenation was <5%. Although both dexamethasone (10 nM) and corticosterone (1 microM) modestly inhibited LH-stimulated testosterone production by Leydig cells, inert 11-dehydrocorticosterone (1 microM) had similar effects, suggesting 11beta-reductase is functionally important. Carbenoxolone (10(-5) M) inhibited 11beta-reduction in intact Leydig cells. However, although carbenoxolone reduced Leydig cell testosterone production, this also occurred in the absence of glucocorticoids, suggesting effects distinct from modulation of corticosteroid access to Leydig cells. In conclusion, rat Leydig cell 11beta-HSD-1 is unlikely to reduce glucocorticoid access to testicular receptors. More likely, 11beta-reductase amplifies glucocorticoid action, perhaps to maintain Leydig cell metabolic and endocrine functions.']",['eng'],"['11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases', 'Animals', 'Carbenoxolone/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Corticosterone/analogs & derivatives', 'Corticosterone/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/genetics', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/metabolism', 'Kidney/enzymology', 'Leydig Cells/enzymology', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Luteinizing Hormone/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Testis/drug effects', 'Testis/enzymology', 'Testosterone/biosynthesis']","['Glucocorticoids', 'Testosterone (3XMK78S47O)', 'Dexamethasone (7S5I7G3JQL)', 'Luteinizing Hormone (9002-67-9)', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.-)', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.146)', '11-dehydrocorticosterone (FO4V44A3G3)', 'Carbenoxolone (MM6384NG73)', 'Corticosterone (W980KJ009P)']"

SHR were given intraperitoneal injections of DHEAS (10 mg day-1 for 70 days) from six to 16 weeks of age. The blood pressure-time curve was significantly (P < 0.05) suppressed immediately after administration of DHEAS. There was no difference between the heart rates of control and DHEAS groups. Serum concentrations of corticosterone and dehydrocorticosterone in the DHEAS group were significantly (P < 0.05) lower than those of the control group. The dehydrocorticosterone/corticosterone concentration ratio was, however, significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the DHEAS group, suggesting that treatment with DHEAS enhanced the overall interconversion of corticosterone to dehydrocorticosterone. The activity of 11 beta-HSD in specific organs of the DHEAS group was affected, characteristic changes being increases in the kidney (14-58%), decreases in the liver (11-27%) and no change in the testis. Direct addition of DHEAS to 11 beta-HSD preparations from the kidneys of control SHR had the same effect as that observed in the in-vivo experiments. The fall in serum corticosterone in the DHEAS group is considered to be related, at least partly, to increased activity of kidney 11 beta-HSD. The inverse correlation of kidney 11 beta-HSD activity with serum corticosterone and blood pressure (-r = 0.628, P < 0.01, and -r = 0.478, P < 0.05, respectively) suggest that DHEAS delayed the development of hypertension in SHR by selective promotion of kidney 11 beta-HSD activity which in turn resulted in lower serum concentrations of corticosterone and its minimal aldosterone-like activity.']",['eng'],"['11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases', 'Animals', 'Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacology', 'Blood Pressure/drug effects', 'Corticosterone/blood', 'Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glucocorticoids/blood', 'Heart Rate/drug effects', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/metabolism', 'Kidney/drug effects', 'Kidney/enzymology', 'Liver/drug effects', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred SHR']","['Antihypertensive Agents', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate (57B09Q7FJR)', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.-)', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.146)', 'Corticosterone (W980KJ009P)']"

DPA is specific to the QO site of ubihydroquinone:cytochrome c oxidoreductase, where it inhibits not only reduction of the [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster in the FeS subunit and subsequent cytochrome c reduction but also heme bL reduction in the cytochrome b subunit. In both cases, the kinetic inhibition constant (Ki) is 25 +/- 10 microM. A novel aspect of the mode of action of DPA is that complete inhibition is established without disturbing the interaction between the reduced [2Fe-2S]+ cluster and the QO site ubiquinone complement, as observed from the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectral line shape of the reduced [2Fe-2S] cluster, which remained characteristic of two ubiquinones being present. These observations imply that DPA is behaving as a noncompetitive inhibitor of the QO site. Nevertheless, at higher concentrations (>10 mM), DPA can interfere with the QO site ubiquinone occupancy, leading to a [2Fe-2S] cluster EPR spectrum characteristic of the presence of only one ubiquinone in the QO site. Evidently, DPA can displace the more weakly bound of the two ubiquinones in the site, but this is not requisite for its inhibiting action.']",['eng'],"['Binding Sites/drug effects', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Electron Transport Complex III/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Electron Transport Complex III/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Phenylalanine/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Rhodobacter capsulatus/enzymology', 'Ubiquinone/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Ubiquinone/metabolism']","['Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins', 'Ubiquinone (1339-63-5)', 'Phenylalanine (47E5O17Y3R)', '3,3-diphenylalanine (62653-26-3)', 'Electron Transport Complex III (EC 1.10.2.2)']"

Assisted living is widely seen as a resource for managed care organizations enrolling Medicare beneficiaries. Flexible capitation payments and incentives to substitute services create opportunities for assisted living facilities and HMOs to form partnerships. Enrollment of beneficiaries in Medicare HMOs has reached 4.5 million and is growing over 30% a year. In addition, state Medicaid agencies are developing programs to enroll elders, most of whom are also Medicare beneficiaries, in managed care programs that include long-term care.

In this study, we identified a novel gene human JTB (Jumping Translocation Breakpoint) at 1q21, which fused with the telomeric repeats of acceptor telomeres in a case of JT. hJTB (human JTB) encodes a trans-membrane protein that is highly conserved among divergent eukaryotic species. JT results in a hJTB truncation, which potentially produces an hJTB product devoid of the trans-membrane domain. hJTB is located in a gene-rich region at 1q21, called EDC (Epidermal Differentiation Complex).

QO IA (3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxy-5-nitrobenzylidene)-2,4-pentanedione), QO IIR ([2-(3,4-dihydroxy-2-nitrophenyl)vinyl]phenyl ketone), nitecapone and Ro-41-0960 (30 mg kg(-1), i.p.) were given to reserpinized rats 1 h before the administration of L-DOPA/carbidopa (LD/CD, 50:50 mg kg(-1), i.p.). Locomotor activity was assessed 1 h later. All the COMT inhibitors (COMTI), with the exception of QO IA, markedly potentiated LD/CD reversal of reserpine-induced akinesia. Similar results were obtained when the COMTI were coadministered with LD/CD. The effect of compound QO IIR was dose-dependent (7.5-30 mg kg(-1), i.p.). 3. The COMTI (30 mg kg(-1), i.p.) potentiated LD/CD reversal of both catalepsy and hypothermia of reserpinized mice. 4. QO IIR, nitecapone and Ro-41-0960 (30 mg kg(-1), i.p.) reduced striatal 3-methyl-DOPA (3-OMD) levels and increased dopamine (DA) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels. Compound QO IA was devoid of any effect on striatal amine levels. In contrast to the other inhibitors, Ro-41-0961 reduced HVA levels as well. The effect of QO IIR on striatal amine levels was dose-dependent (7.5-60 mg kg(-1), i.p.) 5.

Retrospective coding of all cases according to the MTS by experts and case analysis to determine whether any non-urgent coding was due to the system or to incorrect coding.!##!Results!#!Sixty one (67%) of the patients admitted to a critical care area were given triage category 1 or 2 (that is, to be seen within 10 minutes of arrival). Eighteen cases given lower priority were due to incorrect coding by the triage nurse. Six cases were correctly coded by the MTS, of which five deteriorated after arrival in the A&E department. Only one case was critically ill on arrival and yet was coded as able to wait for up to one hour.!##!Conclusions!#!The MTS is a sensitive tool for detecting those who subsequently need critical care and are ill on arrival in the A&E department. It did fail to detect some whom deteriorated after arrival in A&E. Most errors were due to training problems rather than the system of triage.

The majority of food allergies among adults is caused by cross-reactivity of IgE against inhalative allergens also reacting with food proteins. This must be considered in investigations by skin-prick testing and/or specific IgE measurement, since the sensitivity of these tests for inhalative allergens is higher than for food proteins. The most frequent differential diagnoses of true allergies are pseudoallergic reactions to food additives or pharmacological reactions to biogenic amines. The diagnosis of these reactions can usually be based on the history and course under a corresponding diet. In clinical practice additional investigations by double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges are rarely required. A positive challenge test demonstrates only the cause-and-effect relationship of the foods and the patient\'s symptoms but does not demonstrate the underlying mechanism.

However, to effectively analyze the potential utility of handgun safety devices, physicians need to be aware of the safety devices available in the consumer market and how they operate.!##!Methods!#!A wide variety of safety devices are available in the consumer market, which vary in terms of their ease of operation, cost, and the types of injuries they may prevent. We reviewed several types of handgun safety devices, including loaded chamber indicators, manual thumb safeties, grip safeties, magazine disconnectors, drop safeties, built-in locks, trigger locks, lockboxes, and personalized handguns. Each device is described within the context of reducing unintended discharge and unauthorized use.!##!Results!#!This review is not exhaustive. There are other types of safety devices that limit access to handguns. Many of these devices, such as barrel locks and chamber locks, work in a similar manner as trigger locks and have the same limitations. The user of any type of safety device should think about the types of injuries the device is designed to prevent and be aware of its limitations.!##!Conclusion!#!Physicians have the potential to reduce the risk of firearm injuries with their patients and communities.

In Experiment 2, whereas an equal number of reals and simulators reported a memory of their second birthday during hypnosis and then retracted following the challenge, they made different attributions about their memories.

From the sensitivity of the reduced [2Fe-2S] cluster electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectral g(x)-band and line shape to the degree and type of Qo site occupants, we have proposed a double-occupancy model for the Qo site by ubiquinone in Rhodobacter capsulatus membrane vesicles containing the cytochrome bc1 complex. Biophysical and biochemical experiments have confirmed the double occupancy model and from a combination of these results and the available cytochrome bc1 crystal structures we suggest that the two ubiquinone molecules in the Qo site serve distinct catalytic roles. We propose that the strongly bound ubiquinone, termed Qos, is close to the [2Fe-2S] cluster, where it remains tightly associated with the Qo site during turnover, serving as a catalytic cofactor; and the weaker bound ubiquinone, Qow, is distal to the [2Fe-2S] cluster and can exchange with the membrane Qpool on a time scale much faster than the turnover, acting as the substrate. The crystallographic data demonstrates that the FeS subunit can adopt different positions. Our own observations show that the equilibrium position of the reduced FeS subunit is proximal to the Qo site. On the basis of this, we also report preliminary results modeling the electron transfer reactions that can occur in the cytochrome bc1 complex and show that because of the strong distance dependence of electron transfer, significant movement of the FeS subunit must occur in order for the complex to be able to turn over at the experimental observed rates.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/metabolism', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Catalysis', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Diphenylamine/pharmacology', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Electron Transport', 'Electron Transport Complex III/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Electron Transport Complex III/chemistry', 'Electron Transport Complex III/genetics', 'Electron Transport Complex III/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/enzymology', 'Models, Chemical', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Polyenes/pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Rhodobacter capsulatus/enzymology', 'Stilbenes/pharmacology', 'Ubiquinone/metabolism']","['Bacterial Proteins', 'Polyenes', 'Stilbenes', '3-methoxy-2-(2-styrylphenyl)propenic acid methyl ester (103455-29-4)', 'Ubiquinone (1339-63-5)', 'stigmatellin (91682-96-1)', 'Diphenylamine (9N3CBB0BIQ)', 'Electron Transport Complex III (EC 1.10.2.2)']"

Faced with the tremendous challenges of relearning the skills of daily living and psychologically adjusting to a catastrophic injury, the newly injured person is thrust into an overwhelming environment. As early as 1994, when inpatient stays were longer, concern was expressed about the impact of early discharge on the health and well-being of persons with SCI (Ditunno & Formal, 1994). For over 10 years, the Medical Illness Counseling Center (MICC) has offered a community-based, nurse-directed program of Computerized Functional Electrical Stimulation (CFES) for persons with SCI. The program is founded on the belief that when multi-system deterioration associated with paralysis is avoided and a behavioral approach is used, the person with SCI will have a renewed sense of well-being that enables him or her to overcome the challenges of daily living. Over time, the need for expansion of the program became apparent; it evolved into a comprehensive package of medical, nursing, and psychological care. This article describes the essential elements that comprised a successful program design, the benefits of participation in CFES, and the significance of this technology in a nurse-managed setting.""]",['eng'],"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Community Health Centers/organization & administration', 'Electric Stimulation Therapy/methods', 'Electric Stimulation Therapy/nursing', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Models, Organizational', 'Nursing Evaluation Research', 'Patient Care Team/organization & administration', 'Program Evaluation', 'Rehabilitation Centers/organization & administration', 'Spinal Cord Injuries/nursing', 'Spinal Cord Injuries/rehabilitation', 'Therapy, Computer-Assisted/organization & administration']",

After a wash-out period, titration with immediate-release (IR) morphine was started. When a stable dose was achieved, the morphine treatment was changed to slow-release (SR) morphine in equivalent daily dosages. Clinical data and serum concentrations of morphine, M3G and M6G were obtained at the end of the IR and SR morphine treatment periods.!##!Results!#!The mean trough serum morphine concentration associated with pain relief was 66 nmol/l. The corresponding mean concentrations of M6G and M3G were 257 nmol/l and 1943 nmol/l, respectively. Morphine serum trough concentrations showed a 33-fold variation. Seventy percent of the variation was predicted in a model including age, daily morphine dose and M6G/morphine ratio as independent variables.

We present the first 22 patients treated with ECMO at the neonatology unit of the ""Gregorio Marañon"" Hospital.!##!Patients and methods!#!From October 1997 until September 1999, 22 patients were treated with ECMO. In 8 of them ECMO was necessary because of respiratory insufficiency without response to conventional treatment (r-ECMO) and a veno-venous tidal flow system was used. In 14 patients, cardiac ECMO was necessary in the veno-arterial modality because of ventricular failure after extracorporal circulatory assistance during cardiovascular surgery.!##!Results!#!The 8 patients of the respiratory ECMO group had a mean previous oxygenation index of 89 +/- 36.6 (50-150). The mean duration of ECMO was 7.8 +/- 6.5 (1-16) days and the age at the beginning of ECMO ranged between 1 and 151 days. The most frequent indications in this group were congenital diaphragmatic hernia in three cases, meconium aspiration syndrome in 2 cases and 1 case each of septic shock, idiopathic pulmonary hypertension and air leak. The cannula was removed in 5/8 patients due to recovery and 5/8 survived. The 14 patients of the cardiac ECMO group needed veno-arterial ECMO because of severe ventricular failure. Eight out of fourteen were decannulated after improvement. In 5/14 there was multiorgan failure or bad neurological prognosis resulting in death while on ECMO. In 1 out of 14 patients removal of the cannula was impossible because of cardiac insufficiency. The mean age at the beginning of ECMO was 54 (3-178) days. The mean weight at ECMO was 3209 +/- 739 (2700-5000) gr and the mean duration of ECMO was 6 (1-15) days.!##!Conclusions!#!ECMO is an effective treatment in rescuing critical patients when conventional treatment fails. Meconium aspiration syndrome is the pathology with the best prognosis on ECMO.

The protein-repulsive property of PEG molecules are maximized by covalent grafting. We have synthesized silanated monomethoxy-PEG (m-PEG) for covalent grafting of PEG to surfaces with oxide layers. Two different trialkoxysilylated PEGs were synthesized and characterized. The first trialkoxysilylated PEG was prepared by direct coupling of m-PEG with 3-isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane through a urethane bond (silanated PEG I). The other silanated PEG (silanated PEG II) containing a long hydrophobic domain between PEG and a silane domain was prepared by reacting m-PEG with 1,6-diisocyanatohexane and 10-undecen-1-ol in sequence before silylation with 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane. Silanated PEGs I and II were grafted onto glass, a model surface used in our study. The PEG-grafted glass surfaces were characterized by contact angle, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Although contact angle did not change much as the bulk concentration of silanated PEG used for grafting increased from 0.1 to 20 mg/ml for both PEGs I and II, the surface atomic concentrations from XPS measurements showed successful PEG grafting. Surface PEG grafting increased concentration of surface carbon but decreased silicone concentration. The high resolution C1s spectra showed higher ether carbon with lower hydrocarbon compositions for the PEG-grafted surfaces compared to the control surface. AFM images showed that more PEG molecules were grafted onto the surface as the bulk concentration used for grafting was increased. AFM images of the dried surfaces showed that the surfaces were not completely covered by PEG molecules. After hydration, however, the surface appears to be covered completely probably due to the hydration of the grafted PEG chains. Glass surfaces modified with silanated PEGs reduced fibrinogen adsorption by more than 95% as compared with the control surface.

In order to define the respective involvement of other regulative enzymes in the metabolism of 11-dehydro-glucocorticoids in the liver, the objective of this study was to evaluate the kinetic behavior of NADPH:delta 4-3-ketosteroid-5alpha-reductase (5alpha-reductase, EC 1.3.99.5). The interrelations to liver 11beta-HSD1 will be discussed. The kinetic properties of 5alpha-reductase of the rabbit liver were measured by a radioenzymatic assay and characterized with respect to protein-, substrate-, cosubstrate-, and pH-dependence. Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) were obtained for the formation of 5alpha-reduced 11-dehydrocorticosterone and corticosterone metabolites. We found that both 11-dehydrocorticosterone (Km 4.2 x 10(-6) mol/l, Vmax 2,600 pmol x min(-1) x mg(-1)) and corticosterone (Km 0.5 x 10(-6) mol/l, Vmax 38 pmol x min(-1) x mg(-1)) exhibit a high affinity to 5alpha-reductase. With respect to cosubstrate-, pH-dependence and finasteride inhibition, it is likely that 11-dehydrocorticosterone metabolism is primarily controlled by isoenzyme 5alpha-reductase type 1. This study shows that the deactivation of GCS especially of 11-dehydro-glucocorticoids via 5alpha-reductase is an important metabolic pathway in the liver. The metabolic activation of GCS by 11beta-HSD could possibly lead to an excess of GCS in the hepatocytes.
