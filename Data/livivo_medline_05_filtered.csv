Within the context of three parent studies of dementia-related behaviour in long-term care settings, we conducted a cross-sectional correlational study by creating two separate samples of ratings from among all those available. Factor analysis revealed a two-factor structure (engaging, soothing) for the AS. Internal consistency and evaluation of inter- and intra-rater reliability were favourable. A consistent pattern of ratings on the AS and its subscales, moderate subscale correlations, and significant differences between facility types: nursing homes (NH) vs assisted living facilities (ALF) and among selected locations (residents' rooms, dining rooms, halls) within facility types support construct validity of the scale.""]",['eng'],"['Arkansas', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Dementia', 'Humans', 'Michigan', 'Nursing Homes', 'Psychometrics/instrumentation', 'Social Environment']",

Explanations of these effects have concentrated on the retention of talker information specific to each of these modalities. It could be, however, that some amodal, talker-specific articulatory-style information facilitates speech perception in both modalities. If this is true, then experience with a talker in one modality should facilitate perception of speech from that talker in the other modality. In a test of this prediction, subjects were given about 1 hr of experience lipreading a talker and were then asked to recover speech in noise from either this same talker or a different talker. Results revealed that subjects who lip-read and heard speech from the same talker performed better on the speech-in-noise task than did subjects who lip-read from one talker and then heard speech from a different talker.']",['eng'],"['Acoustic Stimulation/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lipreading', 'Male', 'Recognition (Psychology)/physiology', 'Speech/physiology', 'Speech Perception/physiology', 'Students/psychology', 'Task Performance and Analysis', 'Transfer (Psychology)/physiology']",

To investigate the relationship between lifestyle and subjective symptoms, a cross-sectional study was carried out using data from 4,540 workers aged 20-69 years old in a food products company. The subjective symptoms with a prevalence of more than 10% in either males or females were selected as dependent variables: fatigue, dropsical swelling of hands or feet, stiff neck or shoulders, backpain, deterioration of eye sight, dizziness, diarrhea and constipation. We used a multiple logistic regression model to calculate the odds ratio(OR) and 95% confidence interval(CI) for each subjective symptom according to lifestyle: regular physical activity, proper sleeping, nine hours or less of work, having breakfast, having a nutritionally balanced diet, no smoking and moderate drinking of alcohol. We adjusted for age and type of occupation by gender. The findings confirmed the relationship between smoking and alcohol drinking and subjective symptoms in both genders. In addition, proper sleeping was likely to prevent musculoskeletal symptoms in females.']",['jpn'],"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Food-Processing Industry', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Life Style', 'Middle Aged', 'Pain']",
M17584822,['Endometriosis: cost estimates and methodological perspective.'],"[""This article aims to provide a systematic review of estimates and methodology of studies quantifying the costs of endometriosis. Included studies were cost-of-illness analyses quantifying the economic impact of endometriosis and cost analyses calculating diagnostic and treatment costs of endometriosis. Annual healthcare costs and costs of productivity loss associated with endometriosis have been estimated at $2801 and $1023 per patient, respectively. Extrapolating these findings to the US population, this study calculated that annual costs of endometriosis attained $22 billion in 2002 assuming a 10% prevalence rate among women of reproductive age. These costs are considerably higher than those related to Crohn's disease or to migraine. To date, it is not possible to determine whether a medical approach is less expensive than a surgical approach to treating endometriosis in patients presenting with chronic pelvic pain. Evidence of endometriosis costs in infertile patients is largely lacking. Cost estimates were biased due to the absence of a control group of patients without endometriosis, inadequate consideration of endometriosis recurrence and restricted scope of costs. There is a need for more and better-designed studies that carry out longitudinal analyses of patients until the cessation of their symptoms or that model the chronic nature of endometriosis.""]",['eng'],"['Cost of Illness', 'Endometriosis/economics', 'Endometriosis/epidemiology', 'Endometriosis/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Prevalence', 'United States/epidemiology']",

Vernakalant may have potential in the treatment of atrial arrhythmias, including acute atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Vernakalant is a mixed sodium/potassium channel blocker and selectively blocks ion channels in the heart that are known to be active during episodes of atrial fibrillation. An IV formulation of vernakalant is awaiting registration in the US for the acute conversion of atrial fibrillation. Also, an oral formulation of the compound is in phase II clinical development as a chronic-use product for the maintenance of normal heart rhythm following termination of atrial fibrillation. Cardiome is seeking co-development partners for intravenous vernakalant in the treatment of atrial arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in Europe and Japan. In October 2003, Cardiome Pharma and Fujisawa Healthcare, the US subsidiary of Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd (now Astellas Pharma), executed a $US68 million strategic partnership agreement for the co-development of vernakalant. On 1 April 2005, Fujisawa merged with Yamanouchi to form Astellas Pharma. The partnership grants Astellas Pharma exclusive commercialisation rights for vernakalant. Under the terms of the agreement, Cardiome and Astellas Pharma will co-develop vernakalant as an intravenous formulation for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter for North American markets. Astellas Pharma will be financially responsible for 75% of all future clinical development costs, with Cardiome responsible for the remaining 25% of costs. Astellas Pharma will be responsible for the development plan, NDA application (and NDA re-submission costs) and registration, along with the commercial manufacturing, marketing and sale of vernakalant. Cardiome will manage the phase III trials ACT 1 and ACT 2 and will also be responsible for the continued manufacturing of clinical supplies of vernakalant. Cardiome will receive royalties on end-user sales of vernakalant reflective of Cardiome's 25% share of development costs and other financial considerations. Product rights to the IV formulation of vernakalant for markets outside of North America and world rights to the oral formulation of vernakalant for chronic atrial fibrillation are not included within the scope of this partnership. Cardiome intends to form future additional alliances for these product opportunities or maintain such opportunities for commercialisation on its own. Cardiome and Astellas amended their agreement for vernakalant in relation to the re-submission of the NDA with the US FDA. Under the terms of the new agreement, Astellas agreed to fund 100% of the costs associated with re-submission, including engagement and external consultants. Astellas also agreed to modify the timing of the $US10 million NDA milestone to the date of resubmission. In February 2005, Cardiome Pharma received a $US6 million milestone payment from its co-development partner, Fujisawa Healthcare Inc. This milestone payment was triggered by the successful completion of ACT 1.A pivotal phase II trial demonstrated in September 2002 that vernakalant rapidly and effectively terminated recent onset atrial fibrillation and the study met both primary and secondary study endpoints. Following discussions with the FDA, Cardiome initiated three separate phase III clinical trials in order to enable Cardiome to apply for marketing approval for vernakalant. In August 2003, Cardiome Pharma commenced patient dosing in its first phase III efficacy study of vernakalant for the acute treatment of atrial fibrillation. This initial study, called ACT 1 (Atrial fibrillation Conversion Trial 1), measured the safety and efficacy of vernakalant in 416 patients with atrial arrhythmias. The placebo-controlled study was carried out in 45 centers in the US, Canada and Scandinavia. The ACT 1 study included two substudies of 60 patients with atrial flutter and 119 patients with longer term atrial fibrillation. The primary efficacy endpoint was acute conversion of atrial arrhythmia to normal heart rhythm. Cardiome commenced its second phase III efficacy study in March 2004, known as ACT 2. The ACT 2 study in post-cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass graft) patients with atrial fibrillation, evaluated the safety and efficacy of vernakalant (IV) in the termination of atrial arrhythmias in patients after cardiac surgery. Around 210 patients from 25 centres in the US, Canada and Europe were enrolled in this study. The primary efficacy endpoint was acute conversion of atrial arrhythmias to normal heart rhythm. The ACT 2 study is ongoing. The third phase III study, known as ACT 3 (Atrial arrhythmia Conversion Trial 3), was initiated by Cardiome Pharma in July 2004. In September 2005, Cardiome and Astellas reported that ACT 3 had been completed, achieving its primary endpoint, with over half of the 170 patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) who received vernakalant intravenously converting to normal heart rhythm, compared with only 4% in the placebo group. The study was being conducted by co-development partner Astellas Pharma and measured the safety and efficacy of intravenous vernakalant in recent onset atrial arrhythmia patients. The placebo-controlled study was being carried out in 276 patients in more than 50 centres throughout the world.ACT 4, a phase III safety study evaluating safety of IV vernakalant in approximately 120 AF patients from 30 centres in the US, Canada and Europe, was initiated in October 2005. Results from this trial are expected to supplement trial results from the pivotal ACT 1 and 3 trials. This study is ongoing. Cardiome Pharma successfully completed phase I studies for its controlled-release oral formulation of vernakalant in 2005. The oral, controlled-release formulation of vernakalant is expected to help prevent or slow the recurrence of atrial fibrillation, and will be used as a follow-on therapy to intravenous vernakalant.""]",['eng'],"['Administration, Oral', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents/administration & dosage', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents/pharmacokinetics', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents/therapeutic use', 'Atrial Fibrillation/drug therapy', 'Atrial Fibrillation/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Potassium Channel Blockers/adverse effects', 'Potassium Channel Blockers/pharmacokinetics', 'Potassium Channel Blockers/therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recurrence']","['Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Potassium Channel Blockers']"

In the literature there is no clear consensus on where this model stands - theory or philosophy. There is no intent to devalue Patricia Benner's work as it is valuable and has become widely used in nursing practice, research, education and administration. However, as a philosophy, Benner's interpretive work is more constructive. Appropriate use of this model requires an understanding of whether it is a theory or a philosophy, its underpinnings and an assessment of its development and testing. This can be accomplished by knowing the differences between a theory and a philosophy and by reviewing the ways of knowing and processes of reasoning which are necessary for skill acquisition. Much of the critique of Benner's work falls into two categories: it is not quantitative research and there are issues with the use of narratives. These will be reviewed. Judgment and understanding of the nature of Benner's model allows for its appropriate use in journal articles, research, or other projects and/or modification as necessary.""]",['eng'],"['Models, Theoretical', 'Nursing']",

The success and sustainability of ART programs will depend upon durable viral suppression, the long-term maintenance of the infected on first-line treatment regimes. This article considers the data policy that will be required to achieve durable viral suppression. The UNAIDS (Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS) ""Three Ones"" doctrine calls for one national health information strategy for countries that are scaling-up ART. This article provides a framework for standardizing national data policy. The need for standardization must be balanced with recognition that ART programs are still evolving and that excess standardization (imposing forms and electronic systems) should be avoided while best practices are developed and proven. This independent assessment of data policy for ART may be useful in the further development of routine program monitoring and targeted evaluation of durable viral suppression.']",['eng'],"['Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Database Management Systems/standards', 'Developing Countries', 'Directly Observed Therapy/standards', 'HIV Infections/drug therapy', 'HIV Infections/virology', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility/standards', 'Humans', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'United Nations']",['Antiviral Agents']

Twenty-three children with developmental dyslexia and 37 normally developing children, between the ages of 8 and 10 years, participated in the task. The results were consistent with the hypothesis in demonstrating that, despite an overall slowing in response times, dyslexic children show the same degree of implicit learning as normal readers, thus, providing evidence for an unimpaired implicit learning mechanism in dyslexic individuals. These results hold implications for the underlying mechanisms of learning, as dyslexic individuals who are impaired on explicit learning tasks, such as reading, spelling and writing, are unimpaired on implicit learning tasks.

The subjects consisted of 252 immunocompromised patients who were clinically suspected of tuberculosis (TB) infection between April 2005 and December 2006. Regarding the underlying diseases, 74 subjects had malignant diseases, 72 were undergoing immunosuppressive treatment, 52 had diabetes mellitus, 50 had chronic renal failure and four had HIV infection. While the positive rate of the QFT-TB test for the diagnosis of TB infection (TB disease or latent TB infection) was 78.1%, that of TST for TB infection was 50.0%. The QFT-TB test was significantly better than TST. However, 32 (13%) patients had an indeterminate QFT-TB result. Indeterminate findings were significantly more frequent in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (28%), especially with lymphocytopaenia in the peripheral blood, than in those who had other underlying diseases. While TST-positive and QFT-TB test-negative results were recognised in immunocompromised patients with bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination or nontuberculous mycobacterial disease, TST-negative and QFT-TB test-positive results were recognised in immunocompromised patients with a past history of TB infection. It was concluded that the QuantiFERON TB-2G test is a more useful diagnostic method for tuberculosis infection than tuberculin skin test for immunocompromised patients suspected of tuberculosis disease.

The mean age range was 26 (2 - 42) years. In 6 cases a partial vascularized joint transfer was carried out, with the transplant being harvested in two cases from non-replantable finger according to the ""tissue bank concept"" according to Chase and in the other two cases from the PIP-joint of the second toe. In 10 patients a complete vascularized joint transfer was carried out, with the joint being harvested from the hand in 6 cases and from the 2nd toe in 4 cases. The following criteria were evaluated: active range of motion (neutral-0-method), postoperative arthritis, growth and complications. Active range of motion of the transplanted joint was for partial PIP-joint transfer Ex/Flex 0/20/65 degrees und for partial MP-joint transfer 0/20/30 degrees . After DIP-to-PIP-joint transposition active range of motion was measured Ex/Flex 0/20/60 degrees , after PIP-to-PIP transposition 0/30/60 degrees , PIP-to-MP-transposition 0/20/80 degrees and after MP-to-MP-transposition 0/20/57 degrees . The results after microvascular PIP-joint transfer from the 2nd toe for PIP-joint reconstruction were 0/25/58 degrees for PIP-joint reconstruction and 0/15/70 degrees for MP-joint reconstruction.

It is therefore likely that these circuits contribute to non-motor cognitive functions, but this is still a controversial issue. One approach is to examine evidence from neuropsychiatric disorders of cerebellar involvement. In this review, we narrow this search to test whether there is evidence of motor dysfunction associated with neuropsychiatric disorders consistent with disruption of cerebellar motor function. While we do find such evidence, especially in autism, schizophrenia and dyslexia, we caution that the restricted set of motor symptoms does not suggest global cerebellar dysfunction. Moreover, these symptoms may also reflect involvement of other, extra-cerebellar circuits and detailed examination of specific sub groups of individuals within each disorder may help to relate such motor symptoms to cerebellar morphology.']",['eng'],"['Cerebellum/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/complications', 'Mental Disorders/pathology', 'Movement Disorders/etiology', 'Movement Disorders/pathology']",

Although the optimal temperatures of PSII quantum efficiency and CO(2) assimilation were found to be between 25 and 32 degrees C, the maximal activation state of Rubisco was found to be between 16 and 20 degrees C in all genotypes. The Rubisco flux control coefficient was also the highest between 16 and 20 degrees C in the WT and antisense lines [>0.88 at an intercellular CO(2) pressure (Ci) of 28 Pa]. Gross photosynthesis at Ci = 28 Pa per Rubisco content in the WT between 12 and 20 degrees C was close to that of the antisense lines where high Rubisco control is present. Thus, Rubisco activity most strongly limited photosynthesis at cool temperatures. These results indicated that a selective enhancement of Rubisco content can enhance photosynthesis at cool temperatures, but in the sense line with enhanced Rubisco content Pi regeneration limitation occurred. Above 20 degrees C, the Rubisco flux control coefficient declined. This decline was associated with a decline in Rubisco activation. The activation state of Rubisco measured at each temperature decreased with increasing Rubisco content, and the slope of activation to Rubisco content was independent of temperature. We discuss the possibility that the decline in Rubisco activation at intermediate and high temperatures is part of a regulated response to a limitation in other photosynthetic processes.']",['eng'],"['Carbon Dioxide', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genotype', 'Oryza/enzymology', 'Oryza/genetics', 'Photosynthesis/genetics', 'Photosynthesis/physiology', 'Plant Leaves/metabolism', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase/genetics', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase/metabolism', 'Temperature']","['Carbon Dioxide (142M471B3J)', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.39)']"

Here, the molecular mechanisms of interaction of vernakalant with the inner pore of the Kv1.5 channel are compared with those of the class IC agent flecainide. Initial experiments showed that vernakalant blocks activated channels and vacates the inner vestibule as the channel closes, and thus mutations were made, targeting residues at the base of the selectivity filter and in S6, by drawing on studies of other Kv1.5-selective blocking agents. Block by vernakalant or flecainide of Kv1.5 wild type and mutants was assessed by whole-cell patch-clamp experiments in transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The mutational scan identified several highly conserved amino acids, Thr479, Thr480, Ile502, Val505, and Val508, as important residues for affecting block by both compounds. In general, mutations in S6 increased the IC50 for block by vernakalant; I502A caused an extremely local 25-fold decrease in potency. Specific changes in the voltage-dependence of block with I502A supported the crucial role of this position. A homology model of the pore region of Kv1.5 predicted that, of these residues, only Thr479, Thr480, Val505, and Val508 are potentially accessible for direct interaction, and that mutation at additional sites studied may therefore affect block through allosteric mechanisms. For some of the mutations, the direction of changes in IC50 were opposite for vernakalant and flecainide, highlighting differences in the forces that drive drug-channel interactions.']",['eng'],"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution/genetics', 'Anisoles/chemistry', 'Anisoles/metabolism', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents/chemistry', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents/metabolism', 'Binding Sites/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Heart Atria/chemistry', 'Heart Atria/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kv1.5 Potassium Channel/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Kv1.5 Potassium Channel/chemistry', 'Kv1.5 Potassium Channel/genetics', 'Kv1.5 Potassium Channel/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Potassium Channel Blockers/chemistry', 'Potassium Channel Blockers/metabolism', 'Pyrrolidines/chemistry', 'Pyrrolidines/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']","['Anisoles', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Kv1.5 Potassium Channel', 'Potassium Channel Blockers', 'Pyrrolidines', 'vernakalant (9G468C8B13)']"

Both the number and type of higher cortical function deficits (HCFD) in acute stroke patients are important diagnostically and for gauging the extent of neurological deficits. Methods. The Stroke Data Bank (SDB) provided a large prospective data base for such evaluation. Thirty-one different HCFDs, each defined in the SDB manual, were considered. Results. Of 1,805 patients in the SDB, 641 instances of HCFD in 422 patients were recorded in alert patients at initial examination (within the first 7 to 10 days of ictus). Aphasia (41%) was the most commonly found HCFD, followed by neglect syndrome (27.2%), apraxia (11.7%), and anosognosia (11.1%). Agnosia (3.9%), alexia (3.3%), and aprosodia (1.5%) were less frequently found HCFDs. Cardioembolic infarct was most likely to have associated HCFDs (66%), and lacunar infarction was least likely to be accompanied by HCFDs (6%), with infarction caused by large artery thrombosis (50%) and infarct of undetermined cause (47%) having similar frequencies. The co-occurrence of sensory and motor deficits among the eight major subgroups of HCFD showed that neglect syndrome, apraxia, and anosognosia were most likely to be associated with long tract signs, whereas alexia, aprosodia, and agnosia invariably were not associated with sensorimotor impairment. Approximately half of aphasic patients had associated sensorimotor impairment. Conclusion. Our findings show that higher cortical function deficits are prevalent in the acute phase of stroke, particularly aphasia and neglect syndromes. They are more often associated with nonlacunar stroke and some are less likely to be associated with any sensorimotor deficits.']",['eng'],,

M17996505,['Long-term results after vascularised joint transfer for finger joint reconstruction.'],"[""Introduction!#!Vascularised complete joint transfer from the finger or the second toe offers the unique possibility of reconstructing a joint defect on the thumb or fingers using autologous tissue, which fully preserves its growth potential. Indications for vascularised joint transfer on the finger in children are set because of lack of therapy options offering normal growth potential. In adults vascularised joint transfer is indicated in case of contraindication for prosthetic joint replacement or arthrodesis.!##!Patients and methods!#!In a retrospective clinical study 16 vascularised joint transfers to the hand with an average follow up of 8.2 (3-15) years were evaluated. The finger joint defect was caused by trauma in 12 patients, tumour in two patients and infection and congenital deformity in one patient each. There were 14 men and two women. The mean age range was 26 (2-42) years. In six cases a partial vascularised joint transfer was carried out, with the transplant being harvested in two cases from a nonreplantable finger according to the 'tissue bank concept' according to Chase and in the other two cases from the proximal interphalangeal (PIP)-joint of the second toe. In 10 patients a complete vascularised joint transfer was carried out, with the joint being harvested from the hand in six cases and from the 2nd toe in four cases. The following criteria were evaluated: active range of motion (Neutral-0-Method), postoperative arthritis, growth and complications.!##!Results!#!The active range of motion of the transplanted joint for partial PIP joint transfer ex/flex was 0/20 degrees /65 degrees and for partial metacarpo-phalangeal (MP) joint transfer 0/20 degrees /30 degrees. After distal interphalangeal (DIP)-to-PIP joint transposition the active range of motion was measured as ex/flex 0/20 degrees /60 degrees, after PIP-to-PIP transposition 0/30 degrees /60 degrees, PIP-to-MP transposition 0/20 degrees /80 degrees and after MP-to-MP transposition 0/20 degrees /57 degrees. The results after microvascular PIP joint transfer from the 2nd toe for PIP joint reconstruction were 0/25 degrees /58 degrees for PIP joint reconstruction and 0/15 degrees /70 degrees for MP joint reconstruction. Arthritic changes could be seen in three out of four patients with partial vascularised joint transfer. In all complete joint transfers there was no clinical and radiological evidence of arthritis even after 15 years. In the two skeletally immature patients at the time of transfer, normal growth compared to the contralateral donor site could be seen. In eight out of 16 patients complications occurred. In four cases tendolysis of the extensor tendon was necessary. In four patients skeletal misalignment (3 x sagittal plane, 1 x rotation) was diagnosed. In one patient flexor pulley reconstruction was necessary in order to correct a bowstring deformity.!##!Conclusions!#!Whenever possible the 'tissue bank concept' according to CHASE should be applied in finger joint reconstruction using a vascularised joint graft from either an amputated or a redundant digit. Results of vascularised joint transfer have to be compared to those of persisting joint defect, prosthetic joint replacement, arthrodesis, or ultimately amputation of the finger involved. Patients in whom a vascularised joint transfer is anticipated should be informed about the following points: (1) The risk of failure (vascular failure, tendon adhesion, joint stiffness, etc.) is about 10%. (2) The expected active range of motion depends on aetiology, age, donor site and recipient site. Traumatic joint defects show a greater active range of motion than congenital defects. Children have more active joint motion than adults. (3) Because of minor donor site impairment and rapid recovery of normal gait the whole second ray should be amputated after harvesting of a joint graft on the second toe. (4) Hospitalisation takes 1-2 weeks. Immobilisation of the hand (palmar forearm splint) and the foot (lower leg cast) should be applied for 4 to 6 weeks. Intensive physiotherapy is necessary for at least 3 months. Additional splinting is advised for about 6 months. (5) Extensor tendolysis is necessary in a large number of cases but should not be done earlier than 6 months after transplantation.""]",['eng'],"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Arthroplasty/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Finger Injuries/surgery', 'Finger Joint/blood supply', 'Finger Joint/physiopathology', 'Finger Joint/surgery', 'Finger Joint/transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microcirculation', 'Microsurgery/methods', 'Range of Motion, Articular', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tissue Banks', 'Toe Joint/transplantation', 'Treatment Outcome']",

ICU-specific screening tools are now available. The purpose of this study was to identify the incidence of delirium in ICU and explore its associations to clinical factors and outcomes. A secondary aim was to evaluate the usefulness of the intensive care delirium screening checklist (ICDSC). A total of 185 patients in six ICUs in Australia and New Zealand were screened for delirium using the ICDSC over two 12-hour periods per day for the duration of their ICU admission. Some 84 patients (45%) developed delirium. Development of delirium was associated with increased severity of illness (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation--APACHE II--and sequential organ failure assessment--SOFA), ICU length of stay (LOS), and use of psycho-active drugs. Delirious patients showed no statistically significant difference in ICU and hospital mortality rates, nor prolonged hospital LOS. The ICDSC was found to be user-friendly. The incidence of delirium, observed characteristics and outcomes for patients admitted to Australian and New Zealand ICUs for > 36 hours without any history of altered mental state fell in the mid-range and were generally consistent with previous literature.

In addition, when the ICDSC score indicated delirium (> or = 4 of 8), the subsequent overall frequency of each item was also independently documented to describe delirious patient symptoms. ICDSC items were tested for discrimination between delirious and nondelirious patients. Throughout the study, the validity of bedside delirium assessments was assessed in 30 nurses.!##!Measurements and main results!#!We were able to assess 537 patients.

One hundred eight-nine patients (35.1%) developed delirium (i.e., ICDSC score > or = 4). On presentation (and throughout the intensive care unit stay), the most frequent features of delirium were inattention, disorientation, and psychomotor agitation. Each ICDSC item was highly discriminating between delirious vs. nondelirious patients. Correlation between gold standard adjudicators and nurses for the overall bedside evaluations of delirium were excellent (Pearson's correlation R = 0.924, p < .0005).

Here we report a novel, non-cell division function for polo kinases in embryonic polarity of newly fertilized Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. We show that polo kinases, via their polo box domains, bind to and regulate the activity of two key polarity proteins, MEX-5 and MEX-6. These polo kinases are asymmetrically localized along the anteroposterior axis of newly fertilized C. elegans embryos in a pattern identical to that of MEX-5 and MEX-6. This asymmetric localization of polo kinases depends on MEX-5 and MEX-6, as well as genes regulating MEX-5 and MEX-6 asymmetry. We identify an amino acid of MEX-5, T(186), essential for polo binding and show that T(186) is important for MEX-5 function in vivo. We also show that MBK-2, a developmentally regulated DYRK2 kinase activated at meiosis II, primes T(186) for subsequent polo kinase-dependent phosphorylation. Prior phosphorylation of MEX-5 at T(186) greatly enhances phosphorylation of MEX-5 by polo kinases in vitro.

M18217181,['Molecular evolution of arthropod color vision deduced from multiple opsin genes of jumping spiders.'],"['Among terrestrial animals, only vertebrates and arthropods possess wavelength-discrimination ability, so-called ""color vision"". For color vision to exist, multiple opsins which encode visual pigments sensitive to different wavelengths of light are required. While the molecular evolution of opsins in vertebrates has been well investigated, that in arthropods remains to be elucidated. This is mainly due to poor information about the opsin genes of non-insect arthropods. To obtain an overview of the evolution of color vision in Arthropoda, we isolated three kinds of opsins, Rh1, Rh2, and Rh3, from two jumping spider species, Hasarius adansoni and Plexippus paykulli. These spiders belong to Chelicerata, one of the most distant groups from Hexapoda (insects), and have color vision as do insects. Phylogenetic analyses of jumping spider opsins revealed a birth and death process of color vision evolution in the arthropod lineage. Phylogenetic positions of jumping spider opsins revealed that at least three opsins had already existed before the Chelicerata-Pancrustacea split. In addition, sequence comparison between jumping spider Rh3 and the shorter wavelength-sensitive opsins of insects predicted that an opsin of the ancestral arthropod had the lysine residue responsible for UV sensitivity. These results strongly suggest that the ancestral arthropod had at least trichromatic vision with a UV pigment and two visible pigments. Thereafter, in each pancrustacean and chelicerate lineage, the opsin repertoire was reconstructed by gene losses, gene duplications, and function-altering amino acid substitutions, leading to evolution of color vision.']",['eng'],"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Color Perception/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Rod Opsins/chemistry', 'Rod Opsins/classification', 'Rod Opsins/genetics', 'Rod Opsins/radiation effects', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Spiders/classification', 'Spiders/genetics', 'Ultraviolet Rays']","['DNA, Complementary', 'Rod Opsins']"

We performed a randomized controlled study to compare the effect of the OLP to PEEP above LIP and zero PEEP on pulmonary mechanics, gas exchange, hemodynamic change, and lung injury in 26 rabbits with ALI. After recruitment maneuver, the lavage-injured rabbits received DPTs to identify the OLP. Animals were randomized to receive volume controlled ventilation with either: (a) PEEP = 0 cm H2O (ZEEP); (b) PEEP = 2 cm H2O above OLP (OLP + 2); or (c) PEEP = 2 cm H2O above LIP (LIP + 2). Peak inspiratory pressure and mean airway pressure were recorded and arterial blood gases were analyzed every 30 min. Mean blood pressure and heart rate were monitored continuously. Lung injury severity was assessed by lung wet/dry weight ratio. Animals in OLP + 2 group had less lung injury as well as relatively better compliance, more stable pH, and less hypercapnia compared to the LIP + 2 and ZEEP groups.

During the study period, there were a total of 4857 deliveries, with 5051 total births (including multiple births) and 4854 live births. Forty eclamptics were admitted to the ICU, giving an ICU admission rate of 8.2/1000 live births. The records of two patients were incomplete. The average age of the patients was 28.4 years (range 17-4 years). Six patients (15.8%) were booked and 32 (84.2%) were not. The average duration of stay in ICU was 5 days. Twenty patients (52.6%) had antepartum eclampsia, 12 (31.6%) had postpartum eclampsia and six (15.8%) presented with intrapartum eclampsia. Twenty-nine (76.3%) gave birth via caesarean section and nine (23.7%) delivered per vagina augmented by oxytocin infusion. Seventeen (45%) received mechanical ventilation; 20 (53%) received oxygen via nasal prongs, nasal catheters or variable performance facemask. One patient (2%) did not receive oxygen therapy.

This involvement of Rubisco activase was confirmed in heat stress and recovery experiments using transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Compared with wild-type plants, photosynthesis, the effective quantum yield of photosystem II, and Rubisco activation were less thermotolerant and recovered more slowly in transgenic Arabidopsis plants with reduced levels of Rubisco activase. Immunoblots showed that 65% of the Rubisco activase was recovered in the insoluble fraction after heat stress in leaf extracts of transgenic but not wild-type plants, evidence that deactivation of Rubisco was a consequence of thermal denaturation of Rubisco activase. The transgenic Arabidopsis plants used in this study contained a modified form of Rubisco activase that facilitated affinity purification of Rubisco activase and proteins that potentially interact with Rubisco activase during heat stress. Sequence analysis and immunoblotting identified the beta-subunit of chaperonin-60 (cpn60beta), the chloroplast GroEL homologue, as a protein that was bound to Rubisco activase from leaf extracts prepared from heat-stressed, but not control plants. Analysis of the proteins by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis showed that cpn60beta was associated with Rubisco activase in a high molecular mass complex. Immunoblot analysis established that the apparent association of cpn60beta with Rubisco activase was dynamic, increasing with the duration and intensity of the heat stress and decreasing following recovery. Taken together, these data suggest that cpn60beta plays a role in acclimating photosynthesis to heat stress, possibly by protecting Rubisco activase from thermal denaturation.']",['eng'],"['Adaptation, Physiological/physiology', 'Arabidopsis/genetics', 'Arabidopsis/metabolism', 'Chaperonin 60/chemistry', 'Chaperonin 60/metabolism', 'Chlorophyll/chemistry', 'Chlorophyll/metabolism', 'Fluorescence', 'Hot Temperature', 'Photosynthesis/physiology', 'Plant Proteins/metabolism', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Protein Binding']","['Chaperonin 60', 'Plant Proteins', 'rca protein, plant', 'Chlorophyll (1406-65-1)']"

Early stage breast cancer patients, who did not receive chemotherapy, self-selected into an 8-week MBSR program or into an assessment only, control group. Outcomes were evaluated over time. The first assessment was at least 10 days after surgery and prior to adjuvant therapy, as well as before the MBSR start-up. Further assessments were mid-MBSR, at completion of MBSR, and at 4-week post-MBSR completion. Women with breast cancer enrolled in the control group (Non-MBSR) were assessed at similar times. At the first assessment (i.e., before MBSR start), reductions in peripheral blood mononuclear cell NK cell activity (NKCA) and IFN-gamma production with increases in IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 production and plasma cortisol levels were observed for both the MBSR and Non-MBSR groups of breast cancer patients. Over time women in the MBSR group re-established their NKCA and cytokine production levels. In contrast, breast cancer patients in the Non-MBSR group exhibited continued reductions in NKCA and IFN-gamma production with increased IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 production. Moreover, women enrolled in the MBSR program had reduced cortisol levels, improved QOL, and increased coping effectiveness compared to the Non-MBSR group. In summary, MBSR is a program that is feasible for women recently diagnosed with early stage breast cancer and the results provide preliminary evidence for beneficial effects of MBSR; on immune function, QOL, and coping.']",['eng'],"['Adaptation, Psychological/physiology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/immunology', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Breast Neoplasms/therapy', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Health Promotion/methods', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/blood', 'Immunity/physiology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/cytology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/metabolism', 'Meditation/psychology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mind-Body Relations, Metaphysical/physiology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Psychotherapy/methods', 'Quality of Life/psychology', 'Self Care/methods', 'Self Care/psychology', 'Stress, Psychological/immunology', 'Stress, Psychological/prevention & control', 'Stress, Psychological/psychology', 'Treatment Outcome']","['Cytokines', 'Hydrocortisone (WI4X0X7BPJ)']"

Corneal epithelial changes were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy and graded on a standard scale by 2 masked observers. Conjunctival inflammation was evaluated by light microscopy after hematoxylin and eosin staining.

The SBAR (Situation-Background-Assessment-Recommendation) process has proven to be an effective communication tool in acute care settings to structure high-urgency communications, particularly between physicians and nurses; however, little is known of its effectiveness in other settings. This study evaluated the effectiveness of an adapted SBAR tool for both urgent and non-urgent situations within a rehabilitation setting. In phase 1 of this study, clinical staff, patient and family input was gathered in a focus-group format to help guide, validate and refine adaptations to the SBAR tool. In phase 2, the adapted SBAR was implemented in one interprofessional team; clinical and support staff participated in educational workshops with experiential learning to enhance their proficiency in using the SBAR process. Key champions reinforced its use within the team. In phase 3, evaluation of the effectiveness of the adapted SBAR tool focused on three main areas: staff perceptions of team communication and patient safety culture (as measured by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture), patient satisfaction (as determined using the Client Perspectives on Rehabilitation Services questionnaire) and safety reporting (including incident and near-miss reporting). Findings from this study suggest that staff found the use of the adapted SBAR tool helpful in both individual and team communications, which ultimately affected perceived changes in the safety culture of the study team. There was a positive but not significant impact on patient satisfaction, likely due to a ceiling effect. Improvements were also seen in safety reporting of incidents and near misses across the organization and within the study team.']",['eng'],"['Humans', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Interprofessional Relations', 'Program Evaluation', 'Rehabilitation Centers', 'Safety Management', 'Teaching/organization & administration', 'Total Quality Management']",

Coexposure of LBH589 and bortezomib at minimally toxic doses of either drug alone resulted in a striking induction of apoptosis in established U251, U87, and D37 GBM cell lines, as well as in GBM8, GBM10, GBM12, GBM14, and GBM56 short-term cultured cell lines. Synergism of apoptosis induction was also observed in U251 cells when coexposing cells to other HDAC inhibitors, including LAQ824 and trichostatin A, with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, thus demonstrating a class effect. In U251 cells, bortezomib alone or in combination with LBH589 decreased Raf-1 levels and suppressed Akt and Erk activation. LBH589 or bortezomib alone increased expression of the cell cycle regulators p21 and p27. Additionally, the combination, but not the individual agents, markedly enhanced JNK activation. Synergistic induction of apoptosis after exposure to LBH589 and bortezomib was partially mediated by Bax translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria resulting from Bax conformational changes. Bax translocation precedes cytochrome c release and apoptosis, and selective down-regulation of Bax using siRNA significantly mitigates the cytotoxicity of LBH589 and bortezomib. This combination regimen warrants further preclinical and possible clinical study for glioma patients.']",['eng'],"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Boronic Acids/administration & dosage', 'Bortezomib', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Glioma/drug therapy', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage', 'Indoles', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']","['Boronic Acids', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Hydroxamic Acids', 'Indoles', 'LAQ824', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Pyrazines', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'trichostatin A (3X2S926L3Z)', 'Bortezomib (69G8BD63PP)', 'panobinostat (9647FM7Y3Z)']"

A central composite design approach was used for process optimization in order to obtain the acceptable UDCA-PLC. The physicochemical properties of the complex obtained by optimal parameters were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The pharmacokinetic parameters and bioavailability studies were conducted in rats of UDCA after oral administration of UDCA-PLC and UDCA tablet. Multiple linear regression analysis for process optimization revealed that the acceptable UDCA-PLC was obtained wherein the optimal values of X(1), X(2) and X(3) were 3, 60 degrees C and 3 h, respectively. The XRD studies of UDCA-PLC obtained by the optimal parameters demonstrated that UDCA and phospholipids in the UDCA-PLC were combined by non-covalent bonds, not form new compounds.

A PEG tube for enteral feeding was placed in a 27-year-old man with cerebral plasty and a severe scoliosis. After replacement of the PEG tube, he developed diarrhea after each PEG tube feeding. The diagnosis of gastrocolocutaneous fistula was made after injection of gastrografin from the PEG tube. Another gastrostomy tube was placed surgically and the fistula was then also excised.

Ten participants also received specific training of the sensory-motor aspects of articulatory production of individual phonemes during the first 3 weeks of auditory training, whereas the remaining received the same specific training during the last 3 weeks of auditory training. Repetition, phonological awareness, reading and spelling were assessed before the first session, between the two sessions and after the second session. Results confirm the overall efficiency of intensive phonological training, even with exclusively auditory material. The main outcome of this study is a significant improvement of phonology and non-word reading specifically during the periods where the two methods were associated, suggesting a significant contribution of articulatory training to the observed improvement. Finally performance to a motor tapping task proved to be one of the best predictors of training efficiency while comorbid co-ordination or attention deficit did not interfere.

Subgroup analyses were performed if results of individual studies were heterogeneous.!##!Results!#!The inclusion criteria were met by 11 studies; there was a total sample size of 635 prostheses. Overall, the studies had good methodological quality. Pooled sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET for the detection of prosthetic hip or knee joint infection were 82.1% (95%CI = 68.0-90.8%) and 86.6% (95%CI = 79.7-91.4%), respectively. Heterogeneity among the results of individual studies was present (I (2) = 68.8%). Diagnostic performance was influenced by type of joint prostheses (hip prostheses vs. knee prostheses) and type of reconstruction method used (filtered back vs. iterative) (p = 0.0164 and p = 0.0235, respectively).!##!Conclusion!#!In this metaanalysis, overall diagnostic performance of FDG-PET was moderate to high. Caution is warranted, however, because results of individual studies were heterogeneous and could not be fully explored. Future studies should further explore potential causes of heterogeneity and validate the use of FDG-PET for diagnosing prosthetic joint infection.']",['eng'],"['Fluorodeoxyglucose F18', 'Humans', 'Joints/diagnostic imaging', 'Joints/pathology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prosthesis-Related Infections/diagnostic imaging', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",['Fluorodeoxyglucose F18 (0Z5B2CJX4D)']

Thus, many studies have aimed at defining the neuropsychological characteristics of children with FASD. The current article describes the neuropsychological characteristics of Italian children with severe diagnosis within FASD and compares them with controls. It was expected that intellectual functioning, language comprehension, academic skills, and inattention/hyperactivity would discriminate children with FASD from randomly selected peers without FASD.!##!Methods!#!This article presents data from a second cohort of children examined in 2005 as part of an in-school epidemiological study of FASD in Italy. Of 80 children, 23 diagnosed with a FASD, and 57 randomly selected control children from the same first-grade classes, participated. After screening for FASD via growth and dysmorphology, the children were administered a test of general intelligence (WISC-R) as well as tests of nonverbal reasoning (Raven Colored Progressive Matrices), language comprehension (Rustioni), academic achievement (IPDA), and problem behavior (Disruptive Behavior Disorder Rating Scale).!##!Results!#!Children diagnosed with a FASD achieved lower scores than control children on Verbal, Performance, and Full Scale IQ. Profile analysis of the WISC-R indicates overall differences between the groups. However, some intact functioning within the FASD group was found, as the Similarities and Vocabulary subtests were similar to the controls. After an alpha adjustment to 0.004, the Block Design, Object Assembly, and Mazes subtests were significantly different from controls. On tests of nonverbal reasoning, language comprehension, and academic achievement, the children with a FASD scored significantly lower. Moreover, teachers rated children with a severe diagnosis within FASD as showing more inattentive symptoms than controls, while hyperactive/impulsive characteristics among children with a FASD were comparable with the control children. Significant correlations between head circumference, child dysmorphology, WISC-R, and Raven CPM scores are also reported.!##!Conclusions!#!This study indicates that a sample of Italian children with a FASD, when compared with control children, display poorer functioning on measures of general intelligence, nonverbal reasoning, academic achievement, and teacher-rated problem behaviors. The findings also contribute to the formulation of a neuropsychological profile of children diagnosed with a FASD.']",['eng'],"['Attention', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Disorders/diagnosis', 'Child Behavior Disorders/psychology', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders/psychology', 'Humans', 'Intellectual Disability/diagnosis', 'Intellectual Disability/psychology', 'Intelligence', 'Italy', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Pregnancy', 'Social Class']",

Almost 94% of respondents recommended antibiotic prophylaxis for prosthetic joint patients prior to invasive dental treatment as a general principle and 90% of respondents considered that antibiotic prophylaxis was necessary as long as there was a prosthetic joint in situ. The majority of clinicians follow the AHA guidelines; that is, a single preoperative oral dose of 2 g amoxicillin or 600 mg clindamycin if the patient was allergic to penicillin.

Remnant kidneys had proteinuria and reductions in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal blood flow (RBF) and nitric oxide synthase-1 protein expression while QO(2), factored by sodium reabsorption (QO(2)/TNa), was markedly increased. Combined blockade treatment normalized these parameters while increasing sodium reabsorption but, since QO(2) was unchanged, QO(2)/TNa also normalized. Triple antihypertensive therapy, to control blood pressure, and treatment with lysine, to increase GFR and RBF, did not normalize QO(2)/TNa, suggesting a specific effect of angiotensin II in elevating QO(2)/TNa.

The pharmacokinetics of vernakalant were explored in healthy volunteers and in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in 4 clinical studies. Key pharmacokinetic parameters analyzed were the maximum plasma concentration and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve. Vernakalant exhibited linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 0.1 mg/kg to 5.0 mg/kg in healthy subjects, and generally showed dose proportionality in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter who received 1 or 2 vernakalant infusions. Vernakalant was metabolized rapidly via 4-O-demethylation by cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 to its major metabolite RSD1385, which then circulated predominantly as an inactive glucuronide conjugate. In most patients, the maximum plasma concentration of RSD1385 glucuronide exceeded that of vernakalant. Unconjugated RSD1385 was found at low levels in all patients demonstrating either a cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 ""extensive metabolizer"" or ""poor metabolizer"" phenotype or genotype; however, CYP2D6 poor metabolizers had even lower levels of unconjugated RSD1385. The impact of CYP2D6 metabolizer status on vernakalant exposure was explored in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter who received a therapeutic regimen (3 mg/kg initially via 10-minute intravenous infusion followed by a second 2 mg/kg 10-minute infusion if atrial fibrillation persisted after a 15-minute observation period). In the subset that received 2 vernakalant infusions, there was little difference in vernakalant maximum plasma concentration or area under the plasma concentration-time curve from the start of the first infusion to 90 minutes between CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers or between those who did or did not receive concomitant CYP2D6-inhibitor medications. Gender, age, and renal function did not have a clinically significant influence on the pharmacokinetics of vernakalant. These results suggest that an assessment of CYP2D6 expression may not be needed when vernakalant is administered acutely and intravenously to patients with atrial fibrillation.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anisoles/administration & dosage', 'Anisoles/pharmacokinetics', 'Anisoles/therapeutic use', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents/administration & dosage', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents/pharmacokinetics', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents/therapeutic use', 'Atrial Fibrillation/drug therapy', 'Atrial Fibrillation/physiopathology', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/administration & dosage', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/biosynthesis', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Heart Atria', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pyrrolidines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrrolidines/pharmacokinetics', 'Pyrrolidines/therapeutic use', 'Sex Factors', 'Single-Blind Method', 'Young Adult']","['Anisoles', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Pyrrolidines', 'vernakalant (9G468C8B13)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 (EC 1.14.14.1)']"

A high point of his thinking was the development of the Q-cycle model that advanced our understanding of cytochrome bc (1). While the principle tenets of his Q-cycle still hold true today, Mitchell did not explain the specific mechanism that allows the Qo site to perform this Q-cycle efficiently without undue energy loss. Though much speculation on Qo site mode of molecular action and regulation has been introduced over the 30 years after Mitchell collected his Prize, no single mechanism has been universally accepted. The mystery behind the Qo site mechanism remains unsolved due to elusive kinetic intermediates during Qo site electron transfer that have not been detected spectroscopically. Therefore, to reveal the Qo mechanism, we must look beyond traditional steady-state experimental approaches by changing cytochrome bc (1) thermodynamics and promoting otherwise transient Qo site redox states.']",['eng'],"['Binding Sites', 'Electron Transport Complex III/chemistry', 'Electron Transport Complex III/history', 'Electron Transport Complex III/metabolism', 'History, 20th Century', 'Iron/chemistry', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Proton-Motive Force/physiology', 'Sulfur/chemistry', 'Thermodynamics']","['Sulfur (70FD1KFU70)', 'Iron (E1UOL152H7)', 'Electron Transport Complex III (EC 1.10.2.2)']"

Ovarian cancers and adjacent endometriotic lesions have shown common genetic alterations, such as PTEN, p53, and bcl gene mutations, suggesting a possible malignant genetic transition spectrum. Furthermore, endometriosis has been associated with a chronic inflammatory state leading to cytokine release.

Recent studies have however, documented important abnormalities in ventilatory adaptation with a remarkable potential to limit exercise even in the presence of a normal BRR. Among these abnormalities is lung hyperinflation and expiratory flow limitation. This was documented by comparing tidal to maximum flow-volume loops (FVLs) collected throughout the test. In the present study, we wondered whether the advantages of using such a technique within the classic cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) might be obscured by the maneuvers interfering with the main functional parameters of the test, and eventually with interpretation of the CPET.!##!Methods!#!We studied 18 healthy subjects, 19 patients affected by COPD, and 19 patients with chronic heart failure during a maximum exercise test on three different study days in a random order.

The interpretive paradigm provides one means of voicing nursing knowledge, specifically by accessing the lived-experience of nursing. The approach is qualitatively different to reflection and critical incident as it focuses on the taken-for-granted rather than being problem based or problem solving. Hermeneutic phenomenology and constructivism are combined in an innovative model that allows experience to be captured and meaning to be explored, thereby providing a means to articulate knowing in practice. Practitioners involved in operationalising this model considered that it allowed them to articulate a level of practice knowledge which they had previously experienced difficulty in accessing. This approach to knowledge articulation may therefore be useful in assisting to widen the horizon of nursing knowledge.']",['eng'],,

M19045328,['On the assumptions underlying milestoning.'],"['Milestoning is a procedure to compute the time evolution of complicated processes such as barrier crossing events or long diffusive transitions between predefined states. Milestoning reduces the dynamics to transition events between intermediates (the milestones) and computes the local kinetic information to describe these transitions via short molecular dynamics (MD) runs between the milestones. The procedure relies on the ability to reinitialize MD trajectories on the milestones to get the right kinetic information about the transitions. It also rests on the assumptions that the transition events between successive milestones and the time lags between these transitions are statistically independent. In this paper, we analyze the validity of these assumptions. We show that sets of optimal milestones exist, i.e., sets such that successive transitions are indeed statistically independent. The proof of this claim relies on the results of transition path theory and uses the isocommittor surfaces of the reaction as milestones. For systems in the overdamped limit, we also obtain the probability distribution to reinitialize the MD trajectories on the milestones, and we discuss why this distribution is not available in closed form for systems with inertia. We explain why the time lags between transitions are not statistically independent even for optimal milestones, but we show that working with such milestones allows one to compute mean first passage times between milestones exactly. Finally, we discuss some practical implications of our results and we compare milestoning with Markov state models in view of our findings.']",['eng'],"['Kinetics', 'Models, Chemical', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Surface Properties', 'Time Factors']",

The empirical equation of the hole defined using the regression method is: Y x,V = 8.268/V 0.578018 e(0.584x/V0.005). This equation describes the general shape of shooting holes created by velocities ranging from 440 to 750 m/sec.

Choice of an appropriate way to measure quality of life is therefore a key concern. A common error of researchers has been to focus on whether a quality of life measure has been ""validated"". This may be a necessary condition for choice of endpoint, but it is certainly not sufficient. It is easily shown that interventions that undoubtedly improve quality of life, such as Epogen for chemotherapy anemia, will not have an important impact on items in some validated quality of life scales (e.g. ""I trust my doctor"") and therefore will not improve quality of life scores. Investigators are advised to move beyond ""validation"" as a criterion for choosing quality of life endpoints and focus instead on the specific content of different potential measures. A particularly important concern is whether a prior trial showing a statistically significant difference on a specific quality of life scale is published, as this would demonstrate that scores on the scale will improve if patients respond to treatment. In many cases, it is preferable to use specific symptoms, such as pain or fatigue, as opposed to more generic quality of life scales.']",['eng'],"['Complementary Therapies', 'Humans', 'Integrative Medicine', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Quality of Life', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research Design']",

One patient required emergency revision surgery; the other 2 patients are being observed during conservative treatment.!##!Objective!#!To review cases of posterior migration of fusion cages and report ensuing clinical courses.!##!Summary of background data!#!TLIF is a commonly used procedure; however, there are few reports describing cage migration after the procedure. In most cases, when posterior cage migration follows posterior lumbar interbody fusion, emergency revision surgery is required. One recent study reported a case of posterior cage migration after TLIF, which was treated conservatively.!##!Methods!#!Posterior migration of the bullet-shaped fusion cages occurred 1 to 2 months after TLIF in 3 patients. One of the 3 patients had isthmic spondylolisthesis treated by TLIF with bilateral pedicle screw fixation. The other 2 patients had degenerative scoliosis and were treated by TLIF with unilateral pedicle screw fixation.!##!Results!#!The patient with isthmic spondylolisthesis required revision surgery because the migrated cage caused nerve root irritation. The migrated cage was removed and a large-sized cage was employed to achieve stability. The other 2 patients had no pathologic symptoms after the posterior migration of the cage and were treated conservatively and observed.!##!Conclusion!#!Revision surgery after TLIF appears relatively safe because the migrated cage tends to locate more laterally than in patients with cage migration after posterior lumbar interbody fusion. Cage migration subsequent to TLIF may not cause compression of neural tissues, so conservative treatment may suffice for these patients. Unilateral pedicle screw fixation may not provide sufficient stability to prevent cage migration in patients with degenerative scoliosis. Further study is needed to clarify surgical indications for unilateral pedicle screw fixation in TLIF.']",['eng'],"['Aged', 'Bone Screws', 'Foreign-Body Migration/diagnosis', 'Foreign-Body Migration/surgery', 'Humans', 'Internal Fixators', 'Lumbar Vertebrae/diagnostic imaging', 'Lumbar Vertebrae/surgery', 'Male', 'Radiography', 'Reoperation', 'Scoliosis/surgery', 'Spinal Fusion/instrumentation', 'Spinal Fusion/methods', 'Spondylolisthesis/surgery']",

It may be responsible for serious preharvest diseases and postharvest losses in fruits, vegetables and flowers. In this work, several B. cinerea isolates from ornamental plants (Chamelaucium uncinatum, Pelargonium x hortorum, Euphorbia pulcherrima, Lantana camara, Lonicera japonica, Hydrangea macrophylla, and Cyclamen persicum) affected by Botrytis blight in the south of Spain were studied. All the isolates were confirmed as B. cinerea by PCR using a specific 750-bp molecular marker, which is present in all strains of this species but absent from other species of Botrytis. The isolates were evaluated by reference to mature conidia length, sclerotia production, and growth rate. Conidia, conidiophores and hyphae were described by light microscopy and some by cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (Cryo-SEM). Conidium length was measured by using an eyepiece micrometer at 400x power, whereas the growth rate was assessed from differences in colony diameter between the third and fourth day of growth in potato-dextrose agar culture medium at 26 degrees C. B. cinerea showed a high degree of phenotypical variability among isolates, not only as regards visual aspects of the colonies but also in some morphological structures such as conidium length, conidiophores, sclerotia production, and hyphae. Differences were also observed in the growth rates. Conidiation was insignificant in the isolates from H. macrophylla, and P. x hortorum, where the overall appearance was white in all the growing stages, whereas isolates from L. camara, C. persicum and C. uncinatum were mainly grey or brown in mature stages. The longest conidia were obtained in isolates from H. macrophylla and C. persicum (17-18 microm) and the lowest in C. uncinatum (9 microm). All the isolates, except L. camara, developed mature sclerotia after approximately 16 days in the conditions used. H. macrophylla had around 72 sclerotia per colony, whereas C. persicum had only nine after 28 days. The growth rate of isolates from L. camara was the highest (1.64 cm/day). Such phenotypical variability may result in a differential response to plant growth regulators if plants are infected by Botrytis in the early stages of growth. In this way, we confirm, as we have done in other published studies, that isolates show different responses to some plant hormones and inhibitors.']",['eng'],"['Botrytis/classification', 'Botrytis/genetics', 'Botrytis/isolation & purification', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy/methods', 'Genes, Fungal', 'Genetic Variation', 'Hyphae', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Plant Diseases/microbiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Spain', 'Species Specificity', 'Spores, Fungal/genetics', 'Spores, Fungal/growth & development', 'Spores, Fungal/ultrastructure']",

We evaluated whether setting the PEEP using decremental PEEP titration after an alveolar recruitment manoeuvre (ARM) affects the clinical outcome in patients with ARDS.!##!Methods!#!Fifty-seven patients with early ARDS were randomly assigned to a group given decremental PEEP titration following ARM or a table-based PEEP (control) group. PEEP and inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2) in the control group were set according to the table-based combinations of FiO2 and PEEP of the ARDS network, by which we aimed to achieve a PEEP level compatible with an oxygenation target. In the decremental PEEP titration group, the oxygen saturation and static compliance were monitored as the patients performed the ARM along with the extended sigh method, which is designed to gradually apply and withdraw a high distending pressure over a prolonged period, and the decremental titration of PEEP.!##!Results!#!The baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the control and decremental PEEP titration groups. Initial oxygenation improved more in the decremental PEEP titration group than in the control group. However, dynamic compliance, tidal volume and PEEP were similar in the two groups during the first week. The duration of use of paralysing or sedative agents, mechanical ventilation, stay in the intensive care unit and mortality at 28 days did not differ significantly between the decremental PEEP titration and control groups.!##!Conclusions!#!The daily decremental PEEP titration after ARM showed only initial oxygenation improvement compared with the table-based PEEP method.

For scientific purposes the only accepted test for the confirmation of FA/FI is a properly performed double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC).

In particular, it will discuss the predisposing and contributory factors associated with delirium's development as well as effects of delirium on patients, staff and family members.!##!Background!#!Critically ill patients are at greater risk of developing delirium and, with an ageing population and increased patient acuity permitted by medical advances, delirium is a growing problem in the ICU. However, there is a universal consensus that the definition of ICU delirium needs improvement to aid its recognition and to ensure both hypoalert-hypoactive and hyperalert-hyperactive variants are easily and readily identified.!##!Relevance to clinical practice!#!The effects of ICU delirium have cost implications to the National Health Service in terms of prolonged ventilation and length of hospital stay. The causes of delirium can be readily classified as either predisposing or precipitating factors, which are organic in nature and commonly reversible. However, contributory factors also exist to exacerbate delirium and having an awareness of all these factors promises to aid prevention and expedite treatment. This will avoid or limit the host of adverse physiological and psychological consequences that delirium can provoke and directly enhance both patient and staff safety.!##!Conclusions!#!Routine screening of all patients in the ICU for the presence of delirium is crucial to its successful management.

Each of the studies was assessed as having medium quality. Most of the studies were small and many investigated a huge number of outcome variables, which decreased their scientific strength. On outcome variables in which a significant difference was found between the intervention (NIDCAP) and control groups, most studies showed better results for the NIDCAP group. This was particularly valid for cognitive and psychomotor development. Four studies also showed a reduced need for respiratory support for the NIDCAP group. No studies were identified that weighed the total cost of NIDCAP against its effects.!##!Conclusions!#!Despite promising findings, primarily on cognitive and motor development, the scientific evidence on the effects of NIDCAP is limited.

Twelve dyslexic and fifteen treated dyslexic children (>3 months of treatment) were compared with twelve non-dyslexic children in two conditions (mean age: 11.6+/-2.1, 12.5+/-1.5 and 10.6+/-1.7 years respectively).

Balance was assessed by means of a force plate. Results demonstrated that the mean velocity (i.e. the total length) of the center of pressure (CoP) displacement was increased in the reading task only for the dyslexic group. Interestingly, for the treated children, an inverse tendency was observed: the mean velocity (i.e. the total length) and the surface of the 90% confidence ellipse of the CoP displacement decreased for 13/15 patients and for 12/15 patients respectively, while performing the reading task. Values remained similar to those observed for the control children.

Operative indications for TLIF are contested among many spine experts. The optimal indications for using this technique are spondylolisthesis, degenerative disc disease with a specific discogenic pain pattern, lumbar stenosis with instability and recurrent lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy. Various instrumentation techniques and graft materials are available to use in TLIF, and each option has benefits and disadvantages.

Medical informatics have applied an important effort on describing and standardizing Electronic Health Records, and specially standardisation has achieved an important extent on Medical Imaging. Grid technologies have been extensively used to deal with multi-domain authorisation issues and to provide single access points for accessing DICOM Medical Images, enabling the access and processing to large repositories of data. However, this approach introduces the challenge of efficiently organising data according to their relevance and interest, in which the medical report is a key factor. The present work shows an approach to efficiently code radiology reports to enable the multi-centre federation of data resources. This approach follows the tree-like structure of DICOM-SR reports in a self-organising metadata catalogue based on AMGA. This approach enables federating different but compatible distributed repositories, automatically reconfiguring the database structure, and preserving the autonomy of each centre in defining the template.

Twenty-five healthy control children were also recruited from local primary schools. The four groups did not differ in age, gender or full-scale IQ.

Why some lymphomas are resistant is incompletely understood. In the present study, we demonstrated that rapamycin inhibits mTORC1 in DLBCL lines and primary tumors but is minimally cytotoxic. Subsequent investigations revealed that rapamycin also activated eIF4E and the mTORC2 target Akt, suggesting a potential mechanism of rapamycin resistance. Furthermore, knockdown of the mTORC2 component rictor, but not the mTORC1 component raptor, inhibited rapamycin-induced Akt phosphorylation in lymphoma cells. Addition of the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDI) LBH589 (LBH) overcame rapamycin resistance by blocking mTOR, thus preventing Akt activation. Further studies support the involvement of the protein phosphatase PP1 in LBH-mediated Akt dephosphorylation, which could be mimicked by knockdown of HDAC3. This is the first demonstration that a HDI such as LBH can overcome rapamycin resistance through a phosphatase that antagonizes mTORC2 activation. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for a clinical trial of a combination of HDI and mTOR inhibitors for DLBCL.']",['eng'],"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Indoles', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']","['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'CRTC2 protein, human', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Hydroxamic Acids', 'Indoles', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Proteins', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Transcription Factors', 'panobinostat (9647FM7Y3Z)', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases (EC 2.7.1.1)', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (EC 2.7.11.1)', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt (EC 2.7.11.1)', 'Histone Deacetylases (EC 3.5.1.98)', 'Sirolimus (W36ZG6FT64)']"

This review summarizes the published data regarding the safety and efficacy of travoprost. Travoprost provides statistically significant and clinically relevant reductions in mean IOP, of the order of 6.5-9.0 mmHg in most studies. In addition, travoprost provides consistent diurnal IOP control, with statistically significant IOP reductions persisting up to 84 hours post-dose. Travoprost has a highly favorable safety profile; most adverse events are cosmetic in nature (such as iris hyperpigmentation and eyelash growth), although more serious adverse events (such as iritis and macular edema) have been associated with travoprost and the other prostaglandin drugs. In some markets, travoprost is available in a fixed combination with timolol; clinical studies have demonstrated that the fixed combination - dosed once daily - lowers IOP by 7-11.5 mmHg.

In addition to optimizing the resolution between PEG and monofunctional PEG peaks, the major focus has been to determine the molecular weights of PEG impurities in M-PEG and V-PEG of diverse molecular weights. The latter is achieved by examining liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) mass spectra of both monofunctional PEG and PEG in several cases, and matching peak retention times with those of available PEG standards for all M-PEG and V-PEG sample types. This information is helpful in selecting the appropriate PEG standard to determine PEG content in each sample type. ELSD response factors for various PEG standards have also been compared. It has been found that PEG standards with molecular weights from 1000 Da to 8000 Da show responses that are within 10% of each other. However, a low molecular weight PEG such as PEG 400, provides approximately 30% less response compared to its higher molecular weight counterparts.']",['eng'],"['Chromatography, Liquid/methods', 'Mass Spectrometry/methods', 'Molecular Weight', 'Polyethylene Glycols/chemistry', 'Surface-Active Agents/chemistry']","['Surface-Active Agents', 'Polyethylene Glycols (30IQX730WE)']"

To elucidate its role in maintaining CO(2) assimilation rate at high temperature, we examined the temperature response of CO(2) assimilation rate at 380 microL L(-1) CO(2) concentration (A(380)) and Rubisco activation state in wild-type and transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) with reduced Rubisco activase content grown at either 20 degrees C or 30 degrees C. Analyses of gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence showed that in the wild type, A(380) was limited by ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate regeneration at lower temperatures, whereas at higher temperatures, A(380) was limited by ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylation irrespective of growth temperatures. Growth temperature induced modest differences in Rubisco activation state that declined with measuring temperature, from mean values of 76% at 15 degrees C to 63% at 40 degrees C in wild-type plants. At measuring temperatures of 25 degrees C and below, an 80% reduction in Rubisco activase content was required before Rubisco activation state was decreased. Above 35 degrees C, Rubisco activation state decreased slightly with more modest decreases in Rubisco activase content, but the extent of the reductions in Rubisco activation state were small, such that a 55% reduction in Rubisco activase content did not alter the temperature sensitivity of Rubisco activation and had no effect on in vivo catalytic turnover rates of Rubisco. There was a strong correlation between Rubisco activase content and Rubisco activation state once Rubisco activase content was less that 20% of wild type at all measuring temperatures. We conclude that reduction in Rubisco activase content does not lead to an increase in the temperature sensitivity of Rubisco activation state in tobacco.']",['eng'],"['Acclimatization/physiology', 'Carbon Dioxide/metabolism', 'Chloroplasts/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Photosynthesis/physiology', 'Plant Proteins/metabolism', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Temperature', 'Tobacco/enzymology', 'Tobacco/genetics']","['Plant Proteins', 'rca protein, plant', 'Carbon Dioxide (142M471B3J)']"

During the follow-up, in the UDCA group, PSL was added to 8 of 12 patients failing to achieve the normalization of serum transaminase levels with UDCA monotherapy. Cumulative incidence of the normalization of serum transaminase levels was 64% in the UDCA group, 95% in the combination group, and 94% in the PSL group (log-rank test, P\xa0=\xa00.0001). UDCA group required longest periods until the normalization of serum transaminase levels. Eleven patients, who achieved persistent normalization of serum transaminase levels with UDCA monotherapy, did not reach liver failure or develop hepatocellular carcinoma for 49.7 (range\xa0=\xa013.4-137.3) months. Meanwhile, during the taper of PSL, doses of PSL at the initial relapse were lower in patients treated with PSL and UDCA than in those treated with PSL monotherapy, and initial relapse occurred earlier in patients treated with PSL monotherapy.!##!Conclusions!#!UDCA monotherapy is effective for some Japanese AIH patients; however, UDCA monotherapy for patients with either high-grade inflammatory activity or poor residual capacity of liver function is not recommended because they may reach liver failure before achievement of remission. Meanwhile, additional use of UDCA during the taper of corticosteroids may be effective for the prevention of early relapse.']",['eng'],,

By contrast, UDCA-Glu administration resulted in a greater delivery of UDCA to the colon. The fecal bile acid composition resembled that of the intraluminal colonic composition and a higher mass of UDCA (unconjugated 3.39 + or - 0.30 mg; conjugated 6.40 + or - 1.03 mg) was found in rats treated with UDCA-Glu compared to those treated with UDCA (2.27 + or - 0.11 and. 0.04 + or - 0.01 mg, respectively), establishing increased delivery of UDCA to the colon. Both bile acids similarly increased bile flow but the initial effect of UDCA was greater than that of UDCA-Glu.!##!Conclusion!#!Conjugation of UDCA to glutamic acid reduces its intestinal absorption and biotransformation resulting in increased colonic delivery of UDCA. UDCA-Glu may have potential application as a pro-drug for enhancing the action of UDCA in the treatment of colonic diseases.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Bile Acids and Salts/pharmacology', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Colon/metabolism', 'Feces/chemistry', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Glutamic Acid/metabolism', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Ursodeoxycholic Acid/analogs & derivatives', 'Ursodeoxycholic Acid/metabolism']","['Bile Acids and Salts', 'Glutamic Acid (3KX376GY7L)', 'Ursodeoxycholic Acid (724L30Y2QR)']"

Recently, anodal slow oscillation stimulation at a frequency of 0.75 Hz has been shown to augment intrinsic slow oscillations during sleep and theta oscillations during wakefulness. To embed this new type of stimulation into the existing tDCS literature, we aimed to characterize the after effects of slowly oscillating stimulation (so-tDCS) on M1(HAND) excitability and to compare them to those of c-tDCS. Here we show that so-tDCS at 0.8 Hz can also induce lasting changes in corticospinal excitability during wakefulness. Experiment 1. In 10 healthy awake individuals, we applied c-tDCS or so-tDCS to left M1(HAND) on separate days. Each tDCS protocol lasted for 10 min. Measurements of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) confirmed previous work showing that anodal c-tDCS at an intensity of 0.75 mA (maximal current density 0.0625 mA/cm2) enhanced corticospinal excitability, while cathodal c-tDCS at 0.75 mA reduced it. The polarity-specific shifts in excitability persisted for at least 20 min after c-tDCS. Using a peak current intensity of 0.75 mA, neither anodal nor cathodal so-tDCS had consistent effects on corticospinal excitability. Experiment 2. In a separate group of ten individuals, peak current intensity of so-tDCS was raised to 1.5 mA (maximal current density 0.125 mA/cm2) to match the total amount of current applied with so-tDCS to the amount of current that had been applied with c-tDCS at 0.75 mA in Experiment 1. At peak intensity of 1.5 mA, anodal and cathodal so-tDCS produced bidirectional changes in corticospinal excitability comparable to the after effects that had been observed after c-tDCS at 0.75 mA in Experiment 1. The results show that so-tDCS can induce bidirectional shifts in corticospinal excitability in a similar fashion as c-tDCS if the total amount of applied current during the tDCS session is matched.']",['eng'],"['Action Potentials/physiology', 'Adult', 'Biological Clocks/physiology', 'Brain Mapping/methods', 'Electric Stimulation/methods', 'Electricity', 'Electronics, Medical', 'Electrophysiology', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor/physiology', 'Female', 'Hand/innervation', 'Hand/physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Motor Cortex/anatomy & histology', 'Motor Cortex/physiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity/physiology', 'Neurons/physiology', 'Pyramidal Tracts/physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation/methods', 'Wakefulness', 'Young Adult']",

The QuantiFERON-CMV assay for cellular HCMV-specific immunity was evaluated in allogeneic HSCT recipients (n = 43) and patients with hematological malignancies (n = 29) attending a tertiary-care Irish hospital. An intracellular cytokine (ICC) assay correlated with the QuantiFERON-CMV assay. Although there was agreement between HCMV seropositivity and QuantiFERON-CMV assay, six HCMV seropositive immunosuppressed patients with hematological malignancy had negative QuantiFERON-CMV results. The 43 HSCT recipients were classified as high risk (D(-)/R(+)) (n = 18), intermediate risk (D(+)/R(+) and D(+)/R(-)) (n = 17), and low risk (D(-)/R(-)) (n = 8). During episodes of HCMV DNAemia no evidence of HCMV-specific immunity was found using the QuantiFERON-CMV assay. Furthermore, the recovery of HCMV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses in high-risk seropositive recipients of matched unrelated donors was severely delayed, a mean of 200 (SD = 117) days compared to 58 (SD = 23) days for sibling donors (P < or = 0.028). In addition, three patients with late HCMV infection (infection >100 days post-transplant) had delayed reconstitution of HCMV-specific CD8(+) T cells. Interestingly, two recipients (R(+)/D(-)) developed rapid immune reconstitution by days 15 and 36 post-HSCT, suggesting HCMV-specific T-cell lymphopoiesis of recipient origin. Levels of CD8(+) T-cell immunity in HCMV seropositive HSCT recipients were lowest following HSCT. A high number (33%) of indeterminate results was observed immediately after transplantation.

In recent years, different strategies have been adopted to micropropagate poinsettia, which could assist breeders to meet consumer demands. The development of reliable in vitro regeneration procedures is likely to play a crucial role in future production systems. Stem nodal explants cultured on semi-solid MS-based medium supplemented with benzylaminopurine (BAP) and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) develop shoots from adventitious/axillary buds after 7 weeks of culture. Rooting of in vitro regenerated shoots is achieved in semi-solid MS-based medium containing the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA).

To analyze this question, we re-examined the relationship between literacy, baseline physical functioning and mental health, and all-cause mortality for a cohort of 3260 US community-dwelling elderly who were interviewed in 1997 to determine demographics, socioeconomic status, chronic conditions, self-reported physical and mental health (SF-36 subscales), health behaviors, and literacy based upon the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA). All-cause mortality was determined using data from the US National Death Index through 2003. Seven categories of S-TOFHLA literacy scores were created and used in this analysis instead of the existing three categories identified with the measure. In multivariate analyses, a continuous, graded relationship between literacy and baseline physical functioning was identified. However, participants scoring below the third literacy category had significantly worse mental health compared to the highest literacy category, displaying a notable threshold. Finally, all six literacy categories were significantly associated with greater all-cause mortality risk compared to the highest literacy category, but again there was a marked threshold below the third category at which the adjusted mortality rate significantly increased compared to all other categories. We conclude that the nature of the relationship between literacy and health may vary depending upon the outcome under examination.']",['eng'],"['Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Health Literacy', 'Health Status', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Male', 'Mental Health', 'Mortality', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'United States/epidemiology']",

The aim of our study was to determine whether downregulation of adipogenesis that is associated with upregulation of osteogenesis is detected after jump training in growing rat tibiae. Four-week-old rats were jump trained for 1, 2, or 4 weeks for 5 days/week, and the height of jumping progressively increased to 35 cm. We performed morphometry to directly quantitate changes in bone volume and marrow adipocyte distribution in tibiae after the jump training. We also examined changes in the expression of osteogenic and adipogenic transcription factor proteins and mRNAs after the jump training. Four weeks of jump training induced an increase in trabecular bone volume, which was associated with the recruitment of runt-related transcription factor 2 expressing cells, as well as a decrease in marrow fat volume. However, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2 protein and mRNA expression levels did not change after high-impact jump training. The mRNA expression levels of the adipocyte differentiation genes CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs)alpha, C/EBPbeta, and C/EBPdelta also showed no change during the training period in jump-trained rats. We suggest that the levels of osteogenic factors that were upregulated by mechanical loading from high-impact jumping suppress adipogenesis in marrow rather than adipogenic transcription factors.']",['eng'],"['Adipocytes/metabolism', 'Adipogenesis/genetics', 'Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hindlimb', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Muscle, Skeletal/anatomy & histology', 'Organ Size', 'Osteoblasts/metabolism', 'Osteogenesis/genetics', 'PPAR gamma/metabolism', 'Physical Exertion', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tibia/cytology', 'Tibia/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Weight-Bearing']","['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit', 'PPAR gamma', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Runx2 protein, rat', 'Transcription Factors']"

Surprisingly, little is known about the catalytic properties of many environmentally significant RubisCO enzymes. Because one of the goals of RubisCO research is to somehow modify or select for RubisCO molecules with improved kinetic properties, a facile means to isolate functional and novel RubisCO molecules directly from the environment was developed. In this report, we describe the first example of functional RubisCO proteins obtained from genes cloned and characterized from metagenomic libraries derived from DNA isolated from environmental samples. Two form IA marine RubisCO genes were cloned, and each gene supported both photoheterotrophic and photoautotrophic growth of a RubisCO deletion strain of Rhodobacter capsulatus, strain SBI/II(-), indicating that catalytically active recombinant RubisCO was synthesized. The catalytic properties of the metagenomic RubisCO molecules were further characterized. These experiments demonstrated the feasibility of studying the functional diversity and enzymatic properties of RubisCO enzymes without first cultivating the host organisms. Further, this ""proof of concept"" experiment opens the way for development of a simple functional screen to examine the properties of diverse RubisCO genes isolated from any environment, and subsequent further bioselection may be possible if the growth conditions of complemented R. capsulatus strain SBI/II(-) are varied.']",['eng'],"['Base Sequence', 'Catalysis', 'Gene Library', 'Metagenome', 'Metagenomics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oceans and Seas', 'Rhodobacter capsulatus/enzymology', 'Rhodobacter capsulatus/genetics', 'Rhodobacter capsulatus/growth & development', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase/genetics', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase/metabolism', 'Seawater/microbiology']",['Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.39)']

Rubisco synthesis, N influx and the mRNA levels of Rubisco-encoding genes were determined as a function of leaf position in 4.5-month-old Eucalyptus globulus seedlings. Rubisco concentration was slightly higher in the top leaves as leaf expansion progressed and was almost maximal in the uppermost fully expanded leaves. Rubisco concentration remained almost constant in the fully expanded leaves at the top and middle positions and then became slightly low at the lowest positions. Rubisco synthesis was active only in the top leaves. These results suggest that Rubisco turnover rate is low in the middle leaves, leading to the maintenance of Rubisco contents, and that Rubisco degradation primarily occurs in the lowest leaves. Changes in the RBCS and rbcL mRNA levels were roughly parallel with Rubisco synthesis, but N influx was more closely correlated with Rubisco synthesis. These results suggest that N influx rather than the transcript abundance of Rubisco-encoding genes is of primary importance in regulating the rate of Rubisco synthesis.

Fourteen patients who were monitored with a Swan-Ganz catheter and had failed a previous T-piece trial were studied. Three SBTs were performed in random order in all patients: PSV with PEEP (PSV-PEEP), PSV without PEEP (PSV-ZEEP), and T-piece. PSV level was 7 cmH(2)O, and PEEP was 5 cmH(2)O. Inspiratory muscle effort was calculated, and hemodynamic parameters were measured using standard methods. RESULTS [MEDIAN (AND INTERQUARTILE RANGE)]: Most patients succeeded in the PSV-PEEP (11/14) and PSV-ZEEP (8/14) trials, but all failed the T-piece trial. Patient effort was significantly higher during T-piece than during PSV with or without PEEP [esophageal pressure-time product was 292 (238-512), 128 (58-299), and 148 (100-465) cmH(2)O x s/min, respectively, p < 0.05]. Left ventricular heart failure was observed in 11 of the 14 patients during the T-piece trial. Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and respiratory rate were significantly higher during T-piece than with PSV-PEEP [21 (18-24) mmHg versus 17 (14-22) mmHg, p < 0.05 and 27 (21-35) breaths/min versus 19 (16-29) breaths/min, p < 0.05 respectively].

However, in the typical stable osteoporotic wedge fracture, light weight constructions like the Jewett or Bähler-Vogt brace or - in less severe cases - dynamic braces (e.g. TorsoStretch brace or SpinoMedActive brace) should be used to minimize muscle atrophy and demineralisation.

However, the isolated pathogen was different from that of the patient's first infection, so we postulate a reinfection rather than a relapse. All other patients remained free of infection for the observed period.!##!Conclusion!#!Antibiotic treatment can safely be stopped in patients with prosthetic joint infection, even if CRP is not normalized, given that there are no clinical signs of persistent infection and a plateau of CRP level is obtained.""]",['eng'],"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'C-Reactive Protein/metabolism', 'Hip Prosthesis', 'Humans', 'Knee Prosthesis/microbiology', 'Prognosis', 'Prosthesis-Related Infections/blood', 'Prosthesis-Related Infections/diagnosis', 'Prosthesis-Related Infections/drug therapy', 'Reference Values', 'Treatment Outcome']","['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'C-Reactive Protein (9007-41-4)']"
