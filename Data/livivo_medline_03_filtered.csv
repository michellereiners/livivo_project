Risk factors include older age, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, immunodeficiency, and a preexisting joint disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) to which the symptoms of septic arthritis are sometimes ascribed. Staphylococcus aureus contributes over two-thirds of identified organisms; a range of streptococci and gram-negative bacilli are next in frequency. The most common site is the knee, followed by the hip and shoulder. Over 10% of patients have polyarticular involvement reflecting bacteremia and diminished resistance to infection; (over 50% of polyarticular forms occur in rheumatoid arthritis patients). Prosthetic joint infection is becoming increasingly common; chronic forms due to intraoperative contamination and resulting in septic loosening should be distinguished from acute hematogenous infection in which emergency treatment can allow to salvage the prosthesis. Demonstration of the organism in the joint is the key to the diagnosis. Joint aspiration should be performed on an emergency basis, if needed after identification of radiographic landmarks or under ultrasonographic guidance. Seeding the fluid on blood culture flasks immediately after aspiration increases the yield. Antibiotics should be started as soon as the microbiological specimens have been collected. When aspiration is difficult (hip) or inadequate, arthroscopic drainage usually makes arthrotomy unnecessary. Early antiinflammatory therapy (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, systemic or local glucocorticoids, anticytokines, and antiinflammatory cytokines) are being considered as tools for limiting joint damage; their efficacy and safety will first have to be established in animal studies.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Arthritis, Infectious/epidemiology', 'Arthritis, Infectious/microbiology', 'Arthritis, Infectious/physiopathology', 'Arthritis, Infectious/therapy', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Joints/microbiology', 'Joints/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Staphylococcal Infections/epidemiology', 'Staphylococcal Infections/microbiology', 'Staphylococcal Infections/physiopathology', 'Staphylococcus aureus/isolation & purification']",

Failure to respond to INO is multifactorial. We hypothesized that the addition of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) might modify the response to INO in patients who had previously failed to respond to INO.!##!Methods!#!Patients with ARDS who failed to respond to INO at 1 ppm (PaO2 increase of < 20%) were selected. Each patient underwent a PEEP trial using an improvement in static lung compliance as the end point. One hour after the new PEEP level was reached, hemodynamic and blood gas values were obtained. INO was then reinstituted at 1 ppm, and hemodynamic and blood gas variables were obtained 1 hour later.!##!Results!#!Six of nine patients demonstrated an increase in PaO2/FIO2 (161 +/- 27 to 186 +/- 29) with a mean increase in PEEP of 3.7 cm H2O. Each patient responding to PEEP further improved PaO2/FIO2 (186 +/- 29 to 223 +/- 36) with INO at 1 ppm. The three patients who failed to improve after the PEEP increase also failed to respond to a second trial of INO. There were no changes in cardiac output or systemic vascular resistance. Pulmonary artery pressures decreased slightly (39 +/- 5 vs 38 +/- 7 vs 35 +/- 9 mm Hg). Pulmonary vascular resistance decreased significantly after reintroduction of INO (298 +/- 131 vs 310 +/- 122 vs 249 +/- 105 dynes/sec/cm-5) in patients who responded positively.!##!Conclusions!#!The response of ARDS patients to INO can be improved if optimum alveolar recruitment is achieved by the addition of PEEP. PEEP and INO have a synergistic effect on PaO2/FIO2. Patients who fail to respond to INO may benefit from an optimum PEEP trial.']",['eng'],"['Administration, Inhalation', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Pressure', 'Bronchodilator Agents/administration & dosage', 'Bronchodilator Agents/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Compliance', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitric Oxide/administration & dosage', 'Nitric Oxide/therapeutic use', 'Oxygen/blood', 'Positive-Pressure Respiration', 'Pulmonary Artery/physiopathology', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult/etiology', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult/physiopathology', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult/therapy', 'Vascular Resistance']","['Bronchodilator Agents', 'Nitric Oxide (31C4KY9ESH)', 'Oxygen (S88TT14065)']"

Recent epidemiologic studies also suggest that when an infant's head or face is covered by bedding, or when a sleep surface is shared with others, the risk of dying increases. The inference of a causal role for these risk factors is supported by physiologic studies and by the consistent finding that fewer infants die when risk factors are reduced. The prevalence of most of these risk factors in infant deaths in the United States is uncertain.!##!Objective!#!To describe the prevalence of several important risk factors related to sleep practices among a defined population of infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly.!##!Methods!#!In this population-based study, we retrospectively reviewed death-scene information and medical examiners' investigations of deaths in the city of St Louis and St Louis County between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 1997. Because of the potential for diagnostic overlap, all deaths involving infants <2 years old with the diagnoses of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), accidental suffocation, or cause undetermined were included.!##!Results!#!The deaths of 119 infants were studied. Their mean age was 109.3 days (range: 6-350). The diagnoses were SIDS in 88 deaths, accidental suffocation in 16, and undetermined in 15. Infants were found prone in 61.1% of cases and were found on a sleep surface not designed for infants in 75.9%. The head or face was covered by bedding in 29.4%.

Only 8.4% of deaths involved infants found nonprone and alone, with head and face uncovered.!##!Conclusions!#!Using detailed death-scene descriptions, we found that similar unsafe sleeping practices occurred in the large majority of cases diagnosed as SIDS, accidental suffocation, and cause undetermined. Considering these diagnoses together may be useful in public health campaigns during a time when there may be diagnostic overlap. Regardless of the diagnosis, recommendations that infants sleep supine on firm sleep surfaces that lessen the risk of entrapment or head covering have the potential to save many lives.

The purpose of this retrospective multicentric study was to evaluate the safety of appendix grafting for biliary reconstruction.!##!Methods!#!The files of 33 patients treated at 7 European pediatric centers were reviewed. Indications included choledochal cyst (CC) in 5 cases, biliary trauma (BT) in 1, and biliary atresia (BA) in 27. In CC and BT patients, the graft was inserted isoperistaltically between the proximal biliary duct and second duodenum. In all but one of the BA patients, the graft was placed antiperistaltically by patching its cecal end onto the porta hepatis.!##!Results!#!Postoperatively, all CC and BT patients initially became asymptomatic but developed laboratory evidence of anicteric cholestasis within 1 year. The most common manifestation was increased gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase level (GGT), whereas histologic findings showed liver damage (mainly fibrosis). Reoperation has been carried out in 4 CC and 1 BT patients within a mean period of 19 months after appendix grafting. The graft procedure was converted to hepaticojejunostomy (HJ) in 4 and to choledocoduodenostomy in 1. Surgical exploration showed kinking in 1 patient and stenosis in 1. In the remaining 3 cases, there was no discernible cause of cholestasis, and appendix histology findings were normal. In all 5 reoperated patients, liver function findings returned to normal within 1 month. Reoperation is scheduled for the remaining CC patient who currently requires ursodesoxycholic medication to maintain normal liver function and presents histologic evidence of ""de novo"" sclerosing cholangitis. Results of appendix grafting also were poor in the 27 BA patients. Procedure-related perioperative complications occurred in 4 (15%) including 1 early death from graft necrosis. Another early death resulted from intestinal hemorrhage. Jaundice cleared in only 8 (28%).!##!Conclusions!#!The findings of this study suggest that the AG is unsuitable for routine biliary repair in children.

The molecular mechanisms for this process remain unknown, but current views suggest that the plastoquinone pool directly controls the activation of the kinase. On the basis of enzyme activation by a pH shift in the darkness combined with flash photolysis, EPR, and optical spectroscopy we propose that activation occurs when plastoquinol occupies the quinol-oxidation (Qo) site of the cytochrome bf complex, having its high-potential path components in a reduced state. A linear correlation between kinase activation and accessibility of the Qo site to plastoquinol was established by quantification of the shift in the g(y) EPR signal of the Rieske Fe-S center resulting from displacement of the Qo-site plastoquinol by a quinone analog. Activity persists as long as one plastoquinol per cytochrome bf is still available. Withdrawal of one electron from this plastoquinol after a single-turnover flash exciting photosystem I leads to deactivation of the kinase parallel with a decrease in the g(z) EPR signal of the reduced Rieske Fe-S center. Cytochrome f, plastocyanin, and P(700) are rereduced after the flash, indicating that the plastoquinol at the Qo site is limiting in maintaining the kinase activity. These results give direct evidence for a functional cytochrome bf-kinase interaction, analogous to a signal transduction system where the cytochrome bf is the receptor and the ligand is the plastoquinol at the Qo site.']",['eng'],,

For example, like cancer, endometriosis can be both locally and distantly metastatic; it attaches to other tissues, invades, and damages them. Endometriosis is a common disease that does not create a cachectic or catabolic state, and is rarely fatal. There are, however, numerous reported cases of malignancy arising from endometriotic deposits and substantial histologic evidence that endometriosis is associated with endometrioid carcinoma and clear cell carcinoma of the ovary. A large review article by Mostoufizadeh and Scully investigated the association between endometriosis and endometrioid carcinoma, noting that women who had both diseases tended to be younger [1]. They found no association between endometriosis and serous or mucinous carcinoma of the ovary, and reported that malignant transformation of endometriosis was rare and associated with the use of exogenous estrogens. An epidemiological study of Swedish women reported a higher incidence of breast and ovarian cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in women with endometriosis compared with controls [2]. Vercellini and colleagues also reported a higher incidence of endometrioid and clear cell carcinoma in women with endometriosis compared with controls [3]. Mutations in genes associated with galactose metabolism have been identified as one possible mechanism for this association. These mutations are more common in ovarian cancer and have been reported to be more common in women with endometriosis.

Two groups of very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants (< or = 1500 g) were studied. The control group (n=21) was born in 1990, i.e. prior to implementation of the NIDCAP. The intervention group, born in 1992-1993 (n=21), was subjected to formal NIDCAP observation once every 10 days. Development was assessed using the Griffiths' Developmental Scale II in conjunction with a neurological examination. Behaviour was assessed on the basis of a parental interview. Mother-child interaction was assessed according to the Parent-Child Early Relational Assessment Scale (ERA). There was no significant difference in motor development.

These effects were not observed when UDCA was added after irradiation. Glyco-UDCA and tauro-UDCA, conjugated forms of UDCA that are formed in vivo, were as effective as UDCA in promoting PDT phototoxicity. Because UDCA does not act by enhancing intracellular accumulation of the photosensitizing agents used in this study, we propose that the mode of action of UDCA involves the sensitization of mitochondrial membranes to photodamage.

Rates of bedsharing varied considerably (2-88%) and it appeared to be more common in the samples with a lower awareness of SIDS, but not necessarily a high SIDS rate. Countries with higher rates of bedsharing appeared to have a greater proportion of infants bedsharing for a longer duration (>5 h). Rates of room sharing varied (58-100%) with some of the lowest rates noted in centres with a higher awareness of SIDS. Rates of pillow use ranged from 4% to 95%.!##!Conclusions!#!It is likely that methods of bedsharing differ cross-culturally, and although further details were sought on different bedsharing practices, it was not possible to build up a composite picture of ""typical"" bedsharing practices in these different communities. These data highlight interesting patterns in child care in these diverse populations.

M11305228,['The magnocellular theory of developmental dyslexia.'],"[""Low literacy is termed 'developmental dyslexia' when reading is significantly behind that expected from the intelligence quotient (IQ) in the presence of other symptoms--incoordination, left-right confusions, poor sequencing--that characterize it as a neurological syndrome. 5-10% of children, particularly boys, are found to be dyslexic. Reading requires the acquisition of good orthographic skills for recognising the visual form of words which allows one to access their meaning directly. It also requires the development of good phonological skills for sounding out unfamiliar words using knowledge of letter sound conversion rules. In the dyslexic brain, temporoparietal language areas on the two sides are symmetrical without the normal left-sided advantage. Also brain 'warts' (ectopias) are found, particularly clustered round the left temporoparietal language areas. The visual magnocellular system is responsible for timing visual events when reading. It therefore signals any visual motion that occurs if unintended movements lead to images moving off the fovea ('retinal slip'). These signals are then used to bring the eyes back on target. Thus, sensitivity to visual motion seems to help determine how well orthographic skill can develop in both good and bad readers. In dyslexics, the development of the visual magnocellular system is impaired: development of the magnocellular layers of the dyslexic lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is abnormal; their motion sensitivity is reduced; many dyslexics show unsteady binocular fixation; hence poor visual localization, particularly on the left side (left neglect). Dyslexics' binocular instability and visual perceptual instability, therefore, can cause the letters they are trying to read to appear to move around and cross over each other. Hence, blanking one eye (monocular occlusion) can improve reading. Thus, good magnocellular function is essential for high motion sensitivity and stable binocular fixation, hence proper development of orthographic skills. Many dyslexics also have auditory/phonological problems. Distinguishing letter sounds depends on picking up the changes in sound frequency and amplitude that characterize them. Thus, high frequency (FM) and amplitude modulation (AM) sensitivity helps the development of good phonological skill, and low sensitivity impedes the acquisition of these skills. Thus dyslexics' sensitivity to FM and AM is significantly lower than that of good readers and this explains their problems with phonology. The cerebellum is the head ganglion of magnocellular systems; it contributes to binocular fixation and to inner speech for sounding out words, and it is clearly defective in dyslexics. Thus, there is evidence that most reading problems have a fundamental sensorimotor cause. But why do magnocellular systems fail to develop properly? There is a clear genetic basis for impaired development of magnocells throughout the brain. The best understood linkage is to the region of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class 1 on the short arm of chromosome 6 which helps to control the production of antibodies. The development of magnocells may be impaired by autoantibodies affecting the developing brain. Magnocells also need high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids to preserve the membrane flexibility that permits the rapid conformational changes of channel proteins which underlie their transient sensitivity. But the genes that underlie magnocellular weakness would not be so common unless there were compensating advantages to dyslexia. In developmental dyslexics there may be heightened development of parvocellular systems that underlie their holistic, artistic, 'seeing the whole picture' and entrepreneurial talents.""]",['eng'],"['Brain/metabolism', 'Brain/physiopathology', 'Cerebellum/physiopathology', 'Child', 'Creativity', 'Dyslexia/diagnosis', 'Dyslexia/genetics', 'Dyslexia/physiopathology', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/metabolism', 'Fixation, Ocular/physiology', 'Humans', 'Motion Perception/physiology', 'Parietal Lobe/physiopathology', 'Phonetics', 'Psychological Theory', 'Vision, Binocular/physiology', 'Visual Cortex/physiopathology', 'Visual Fields/physiology', 'Visual Perception/physiology']","['Fatty Acids, Unsaturated']"

Numbers of double-negative cells and single-positive cells were not significantly affected by corticosterone, dehydrocorticosterone, or both together.

Commonly in vitro methods yield activities that are less than those obtained in vivo. Rubisco activity was measured both in vivo and in vitro using a spectrophotometric technique in mature Pinus taeda L. (loblolly pine) trees grown using free-air CO2 enrichment in elevated (56 Pa) and current (36 Pa) pCO2. In addition, for studies where both in vivo and in vitro values of Rubisco activity were reported net CO2 uptake rate (A) was modelled based on the in vivo and in vitro values of Rubisco activity reported in the literature. Both the modelling exercise and the experimental data showed that the in vitro values of Rubisco activity were insufficient to account for the observed values of A. A trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation of the protein from samples taken in parallel with those used for activity analysis was co-electrophoresed with the extract used for determining in vitro Rubisco activity. There was significantly more Rubisco present in the TCA precipitated samples, suggesting that the underestimation of Rubisco activity in vitro was attributable to an insufficient extraction of Rubisco protein prior to activity analysis. Correction of in vitro values to account for the under-represented Rubisco yielded mechanistically valid values for Rubisco activity. However, despite the low absolute values for Rubisco activity determined in vitro, the trends reported with CO2 treatment concurred with, and were of equal magnitude to, those observed in Rubisco activity measured in vivo.']",['eng'],"['Carbon Dioxide/metabolism', 'Cycadopsida/enzymology', 'Models, Biological', 'Photosynthesis/physiology', 'Pinus taeda', 'Plant Proteins/drug effects', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase/drug effects', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase/metabolism', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Trichloroacetic Acid/pharmacology']","['Plant Proteins', 'Carbon Dioxide (142M471B3J)', 'Trichloroacetic Acid (5V2JDO056X)', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.39)']"

Using near infrared spectroscopy changes in cerebral blood volume and cerebral oxygenation index were assessed. Heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation, PCO2, and arterial blood pressure were registered continuously. Data were compared at 30, 60 and 120 seconds after the beginning of suctioning and surfactant administration.!##!Results!#!Endotracheal suctioning and surfactant administration induced a similar decrease in heart rate (-29/min, SD 25, p < 0.01 and -30/min, SD 23, p < 0.001) during the first 30 seconds and in oxygen saturation at the 30 seconds datapoint (-3%, SD 2, p < 0.01 and -3%, SD 6, p < 0.05). The decrease in oxygen saturation persisted at 60 seconds after the start of suctioning (-4%, SD 5, p < 0.05). In contrast, oxygen saturation was no longer different from baseline levels 60 seconds after surfactant administration (+1%, SD 6, p = 0.5). After suctioning, cerebral oxygenation index had decreased significantly from baseline levels at 30, 60, and 120 seconds. In contrast, after surfactant administration, no significant difference from baseline was noted at 30 and 60 seconds and a significant increase occurred at 120 seconds. Mean arterial blood pressure, PCO2, and cerebral blood volume did not change significantly during endotracheal suctioning and during surfactant administration.!##!Conclusions!#!Acute decreases in heart rate and oxygen saturation during bolus administration of surfactant are equal to effects occurring during endotracheal suctioning.

Focusing on four areas--sources of support and advice; infant feeding; infant sleeping arrangements; and traditional practices and beliefs--it explores inter-ethnic similarities and differences and intra-ethnic tensions. The international literature indicates that there can be significant cultural variation in infant care practices and in the meanings attributed to them. There is, however, little New Zealand literature on this topic, despite its importance for effective health service and health message delivery. Participants were primary caregivers of infants under 12 months. An average of six focus groups were conducted within each ethnic group, resulting in a total of 37 groups comprising 150 participants. We found similarities across all ethnic groups in the perceived importance of breastfeeding and the difficulties experienced in establishing and maintaining this practice. The spectrum of behaviours ranged widely with differences most pronounced between Pacific caregivers, especially those Island-raised, and Pakeha caregivers, especially those in nuclear families. Amongst the former, norms included: the family as central in providing support and advice; infant bedsharing; abdominal rubbing during pregnancy; baby massage; and the importance of adhering to traditional protocols to ensure infant well-being. Amongst the latter, norms included: strong reliance on professional advice; looser family support networks; the infant sleeping in a cot; and adherence to Western biomedical understandings of health and illness. Maori caregivers bridged the spectrum created by these groups and exhibited a diverse range of practices. Intra-cultural differences were present in all groups indicating the dynamic nature of cultural practices. They were most evident between Pacific-raised and New Zealand-raised Pacific caregivers, with the latter attempting to marry traditional with Western beliefs and practices.']",['eng'],"['Breast Feeding', 'Cross-Cultural Comparison', 'Culture', 'Ethnic Groups/psychology', 'Europe/ethnology', 'Focus Groups', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Care/methods', 'Infant Care/psychology', 'Infant, Newborn', 'New Zealand', 'Oceanic Ancestry Group/psychology', 'Pacific Islands/ethnology', 'Parenting/ethnology', 'Sleep', 'Social Support']",

A pulmonary artery flotation catheter was in place as part of their routine management. Changes in PEEP were made from 0 to 14 cm H2O to determine the level of PEEP, which increased PO(2) without decreasing cardiac output (ie, assessment of best PEEP). Static lung compliance and auto-PEEP were obtained from the pressure signal on the ventilator. The change in Pra with a spontaneous inspiratory effort (ie, triggered breath) was used to determine whether patients had a restrictive (ie, operating on the flat part of the Starling curve), or nonrestrictive pattern (acting on the ascending part of the Starling curve) as previously described.!##!Results!#!Cardiac output decreased 0.7 +/- 0.8 L/min (change from baseline P <.05) in the group with an inspiratory decrease in Pra and -0.04 +/- 1.50 L/min (P = NS) in the group without an inspiratory decrease in Pra. The groups were not significantly different. However, the variance in cardiac output was large and, in contrast to our hypothesis, two patients in the group with an inspiratory decrease in Pra did not have a decrease in cardiac output. Pra and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure after the PEEP trial were greater than before, indicating that reflex circulatory adjustments occurred in response to the PEEP.!##!Conclusions!#!The inspiratory pattern in Pra does not predict the response to cardiac output to PEEP in individual patients. This is most likely because of reflex adaptations in the circuit that occur with the application of PEEP. The response of a patient to PEEP is affected by the patient's volume reserves, filling status of the right atrium, and neurosympathetic activity.""]",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Atrial Function, Right', 'Cardiac Output/physiology', 'Hemodynamics', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Positive-Pressure Respiration', 'Respiratory Function Tests', 'United States']",

In the emergency room many patients with acute back pain are treated with intravenous non-steroidal analgesics. Whether this treatment is superior to oral administration of non-steroidal analgesics is unknown. Intravenous administration, however, requires considerable amounts of resources and accounts for high workload in busy clinics. In the further course centrally acting muscle relaxants are prescribed but the effectiveness remains unclear. The objective of this study is on the one hand to compare the effectiveness of intravenous with oral non-steroidal analgesics for acute treatment and on the other hand to compare the effectiveness of a centrally active muscle relaxant with placebo given for three days after presentation to the ED (emergency department). METHODS/DESIGN: This study is intended as a randomised controlled factorial trial mainly for two reasons: (1) the sequence of treatments resembles the actual proceedings in every-day clinical practice, which is important for the generalisability of the results and (2) this design allows to take interactions between the two sequential treatment strategies into account. There is a patient preference arm included because patients preference is an important issue providing valuable information: (1) it allows to assess the interaction between desired treatment and outcome, (2) results can be extrapolated to a wider group while (3) conserving the advantages of a fully randomised controlled trial.

The aim of the present study was to determine the cellular expression of GR, MR, 11betaHSD1, and 11betaHSD2 in neonatal rat heart and determine the role these enzymes play in modulating glucocorticoid and aldosterone action. Ribonuclease protection analysis and steroid binding assays showed that GR is expressed in both cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts, whereas MR is expressed only in myocytes. 11betaHSD2 was not detected in cardiac cells, but 11betaHSD1 was expressed at high levels in both cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts. Enzyme activity studies demonstrated that 11betaHSD1 acted as a reductase only, converting biologically inactive 11-dehydrocorticosterone to corticosterone, which then stimulated serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase gene transcription via GR. In both cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts, aldosterone stimulated serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase gene expression exclusively via GR, but not MR, indicating that aldosterone can have glucocorticoid-like actions in heart. The ability of cardiac cells to use both circulating corticosterone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone as a source of glucocorticoid suggests that the heart is under tonic glucocorticoid control, implying that glucocorticoids play important homeostatic roles in the heart.']",['eng'],"['11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Corticosterone/analogs & derivatives', 'Corticosterone/genetics', 'Corticosterone/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/pharmacology', 'Immediate-Early Proteins', 'Myocardium/cytology', 'Myocardium/enzymology', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/metabolism', 'Receptors, Mineralocorticoid/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects']","['Immediate-Early Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid', 'Receptors, Mineralocorticoid', 'Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.-)', '11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.146)', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases (EC 2.7.11.1)', 'serum-glucocorticoid regulated kinase (EC 2.7.11.1)', '11-dehydrocorticosterone (FO4V44A3G3)', 'Corticosterone (W980KJ009P)']"

The literature on oronasal blood in sudden infant death is limited. The goal of this study was to determine the frequency of oronasal blood in sudden infant deaths and to examine possible causative factors. Oronasal blood was described in 28 (7%) of 406 cases of sudden infant death. Oronasal blood could not be attributed to cardiopulmonary resuscitation in 14 cases, including 10 (3%) of 300 cases of SIDS, 2 (14%) of 14 accidental suffocation cases, and 2 (15%) of 13 undetermined cases. Eight of the 10 infants in cases of sudden infant death were bedsharing: 5 with both parents, 2 between both parents. The infant in 1 SIDS case was from a family that had had three referrals to Child Protective Services. Oronasal blood not attributable to cardiopulmonary resuscitation occurs rarely in SIDS when the infant is sleeping supine in a safe environment. Bedsharing may place infants at risk of suffocation from overlaying. Oronasal blood observed before cardiopulmonary resuscitation is given is probably of oronasal skin or mucous membrane origin and may be a sign of accidental or inflicted suffocation. Sanguineous secretions that are mucoid or frothy are likely of remote origin, such as lung alveoli. The use of an otoscope to establish the origin of oronasal blood in cases of sudden infant death is recommended.']",['eng'],"['California/epidemiology', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/adverse effects', 'Comorbidity', 'Epistaxis/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Care/methods', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mouth', 'Mucus/chemistry', 'Nasal Mucosa/blood supply', 'Observer Variation', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sudden Infant Death/epidemiology']",

Effects on growth factors, cytokines, and hormones (components of the immune and endocrine systems) are potential means of mediating the possible promotion of endometriosis by dioxins. Studies on epidemiology and on structure-activity relationships of organochlorine chemicals and endometriosis have been additional approaches to this problem. In this regard, toxic equivalence (TEQ) appears to be an important determinant of the effects of organochlorine chemicals on endometriosis.

The precise cause-effect relationship between endometriosis and infertility remains controversial. In advanced cases of endometriosis, with distorted pelvic anatomy, the mechanism of infertility is more easily explained. Recent evidence suggests that treatment of early-stage endometriosis may increase pregnancy rates. Many etiologies of infertility in early-stage endometriosis have been proposed. These include endocrine dysfunctions such as luteal phase defect and luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome. In the last 15 years, alterations in the local pelvic immune environment have been the subject of multiple basic science investigations.

We tested the hypothesis that the increased respiratory rate used in the ARDSNet lower VT strategy might have led to intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP(i)), raising total PEEP (PEEP(total)). Ten patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were ventilated using the ARDSNet lower VT protocol. Respiratory rate was then reduced (10-15 breaths/minute) to obtain a VT of 12 ml/kg (ARDSNet traditional VT). PEEP on the ventilator (PEEP(nominal): 10.1 +/- 0.7 cm H2O), FIO2 (0.7 +/- 0.1), and minute ventilation (VE: 12.4 +/- 1.7 L/minute) were set using the ARDSNet protocol and maintained constant during the two ventilatory strategies. Values of airway pressure at end-expiration of a regular breath (PEEP(external)) and 3-5 seconds after the onset of an end-expiratory occlusion (PEEP(total)) were measured. PEEP(i) was calculated by subtracting PEEP(external) from PEEP(total).

However, posterior epistaxis is occasionally complicated and needs hospitalization. The aim of this study is to analyze the etiology of epistaxis that requires hospitalization, and present the results of the treatments.!##!Methods!#!From June 1997 to May 1999, 44 patients admitted under diagnosis of epistaxis were retrospectively investigated. Among these patients, 7 were admitted twice for epistaxis. The demographics, administrative history, post-history and associated diseases, treatment and complications were analyzed. Noninterventional treatment comprised of nasal packing and local electrocauterization; interventional treatment included surgery and embolization.!##!Results!#!The mean age of the patients enrolled was 53.4 years. Men outnumbered women in a rate of 3:1. The mean length for hospital stays was 8.1 days for noninterventionally-treated patients, 11.8 days for interventionally-treated patients. Emergency room visit prior to admission was noted in 68.6% of the patients. Hypertension, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after radiotherapy, a history of nasal operations and smoking were four major associated diseases. The failure rate to control the epistaxis was 26.7% for noninterventional treatments and 16.7% for interventional treatments. The complication rate was 2% for the entire study, and the mortality rate was 7.8%. All the mortal patients were post-irradiation NPC patients with internal carotid artery bleeding.!##!Conclusions!#!Most epistaxis patients can be managed in a noninterventional manner. Interventional treatment is only warranted in those whose epistaxis persists after adequate noninterventional treatment. For internal carotid artery epistaxis in NPC patients, embolization should be performed as soon as possible.']",['eng'],"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epistaxis/complications', 'Epistaxis/epidemiology', 'Epistaxis/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",

The aim of the present study was to determine whether quiet sleep (QS) in VLBW infants is affected by NIDCAP care. Twenty-two infants with a gestational age of <32 wk at birth randomly received either NIDCAP (n = 11) or conventional care (n = 11). These two groups were comparable (mean (SD)) with respect to birthweight (1021 (240) vs 913 (362)g, respectively) and gestational age (27.1 (1.7) vs 26.4 (1.8) wk). The infants in the NIDCAP group were cared for in a separate room by a group of specially trained nurses and subjected to weekly NIDCAP observations until they reached a postconceptional age (PCA) of 36 wk. Quiet sleep (QS) was assessed from 24-h amplitude-integrated EEGs recorded at 32 and 36 wk of PCA. The percentage of time [mean (SD)] spent in QS at 32 wk of PCA was 33.5 (2.6) % for the NIDCAP group and 33.3 (6.9) % for the control infants (ns). At 36 wk, the corresponding values were 24.5 (3.2) % and 25.7 (4.7) %, respectively (ns).

A total of 254 subjects aged from 60 to 91 years of age, with a mean age of 73.9 (SD 6.8) were examined. The mini mental state examination (MMSE) was used to identify cognitive impairment. White matter lesions and cerebral atrophy on MR images were measured quantitatively. A multivariate analysis was also performed with the existence of cognitive impairment as the dependent variable, and the MRI findings and clinical observations were used as the independent variables.!##!Results!#!Cognitive impairment was present in 46 subjects (18.1%). They were older, had a lower educational level, and more frequent hypertension compared with those without cognitive impairment. The packed cell volume was lower in the impaired group. In addition, their MRI findings showed significantly larger quantities of white matter lesions and cerebral atrophy, as well as more infarcts. A logistic regression analysis demonstrated a significant relation among such factors as white matter lesions (odds ratio (OR) 1.575, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.123-2.208), cerebral atrophy (OR 0.761, 95%CI 0.587-0.987), and lower education (OR 0.682, 95%CI 0.544-0.855) for subjects with a cognitive impairment.!##!Conclusions!#!White matter lesions and cerebral atrophy are factors which induce a cognitive impairment in community dwelling elderly subjects without dementia.

Normally, the SR Ca2+ stores are mobilized through the mechanism of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). In this process, Ca2+ enters the cell through plasmalemmal voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels to activate the Ca2+ release channels in the SR membrane. Consequently, the control of Ca2+ release by cytosolic Ca2+ has traditionally been the main focus of cardiac excitation-contraction (EC) coupling research. Evidence obtained recently suggests that SR Ca release is controlled not only by cytosolic Ca2+, but also by Ca2+ in the lumen of the SR. The presence of a luminal Ca2+ sensor regulating release of SR luminal Ca2+ potentially has profound implications for our understanding of EC coupling and intracellular Ca2+ cycling. Here we review evidence, obtained using in situ and in vitro approaches, in support of such a luminal Ca2+ sensor in cardiac muscle. We also discuss the role of control of Ca2+ release channels by luminal Ca2+ in termination and stabilization of CICR, as well as in shaping the response of cardiac myocytes to various inotropic influences and diseased states such as Ca2+ overload and heart failure.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Calcium Channels/physiology', 'Heart/physiology', 'Heart/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Myocardium/cytology', 'Myocardium/metabolism', 'Myocardium/pathology', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum/pathology', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum/physiology']","['Calcium Channels', 'Calcium (SY7Q814VUP)']"

ETF-QO is an integral membrane protein, and the primary sequences of human and porcine ETF-QO were deduced from the sequences of the cloned cDNAs. We have expressed human ETF-QO in Sf9 insect cells using a baculovirus vector. The cDNA encoding the entire protein, including the mitochondrial targeting sequence, was present in the vector. We isolated a membrane-bound form of the enzyme that has a molecular mass identical with that of the mature porcine protein as determined by SDS/PAGE and has an N-terminal sequence that is identical with that predicted for the mature holoenzyme. These data suggest that the heterologously expressed ETF-QO is targeted to mitochondria and processed to the mature, catalytically active form. The detergent-solubilized protein was purified by ion-exchange and hydroxyapatite chromatography. Absorption and EPR spectroscopy and redox titrations are consistent with the presence of flavin and iron-sulphur centres that are very similar to those in the equivalent porcine and bovine proteins. Additionally, the redox potentials of the two prosthetic groups appear similar to those of the other eukaryotic ETF-QO proteins. The steady-state kinetic constants of human ETF-QO were determined with ubiquinone homologues, a ubiquinone analogue, and with human wild-type ETF and a Paracoccus-human chimaeric ETF as varied substrates. The results demonstrate that this expression system provides sufficient amounts of human ETF-QO to enable crystallization and mechanistic investigations of the iron-sulphur flavoprotein.']",['eng'],"['Animals', 'Baculoviridae', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'DNA Primers', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Electron-Transferring Flavoproteins', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases/chemistry', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases/genetics', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases/metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins', 'Kinetics', 'Multienzyme Complexes/chemistry', 'Multienzyme Complexes/genetics', 'Multienzyme Complexes/metabolism', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/isolation & purification', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Spodoptera', 'Transfection']","['DNA Primers', 'Electron-Transferring Flavoproteins', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins', 'Multienzyme Complexes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases (EC 1.14.19.-)', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors (EC 1.5.-)', 'electron-transferring-flavoprotein dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.5.1)']"

Following absorption into the eye, the free acid form of travoprost interacts with the endogenous FP prostanoid receptor to enhance aqueous humor outflow and lower intraocular pressure (IOP). Travoprost is distinguished from other marketed prostaglandin analogues in that it is a full agonist at the prostaglandin receptor. It is also highly selective with little or no affinity for other prostanoid or non-prostanoid receptors in the eye. Travoprost provides robust lowering of IOP with little diurnal fluctuation and results in low target pressures in a large percentage of patients. In controlled clinical trials, travoprost 0.004% o.d. used as monotherapy produced greater IOP reduction than timolol 0.5% b.i.d. and equal or greater reduction than latanoprost 0.005%o.d. Travoprost 0.004% was also shown to be an effective adjunctive agent offering an additional 5 - 7 mmHg IOP reduction in patients inadequately controlled on timolol 0.5%. Subgroup analysis of a large Phase III trial revealed travoprost 0.004% to be significantly more effective at lowering IOP in African American patients by almost 2 mmHg compared to non-African Americans. Moreover, a higher percentage of African American patients responded to travoprost 0.004% and reached lower target pressures than with either latanoprost 0.005% or timolol 0.5%. Travoprost is a very stable compound, maintaining its efficacy following exposure to extremely low and high temperatures, repeated freezing and thawing and exposure to light. Throughout all clinical trials, travoprost was found to be safe and well-tolerated with very few (< 5%) discontinuations due to adverse events. Travoprost 0.004% represents a clinically significant advance for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension, offering superior IOP reduction and diurnal control, especially among African American patients, in a safe, well-tolerated, stable formulation.']",['eng'],"['Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/therapeutic use', 'Antihypertensive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cloprostenol/administration & dosage', 'Cloprostenol/analogs & derivatives', 'Cloprostenol/pharmacology', 'Cloprostenol/therapeutic use', 'Continental Population Groups', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Glaucoma/drug therapy', 'Glaucoma/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Intraocular Pressure/drug effects', 'Ocular Hypertension/drug therapy', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin/drug effects', 'Timolol/therapeutic use', 'Travoprost']","['Adrenergic beta-Antagonists', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin', 'prostaglandin F2alpha receptor', 'Cloprostenol (4208238832)', 'Timolol (817W3C6175)', 'Travoprost (WJ68R08KX9)']"

Hospice and palliative care philosophy treats the patient and family as the unit of care. End-of-life decision-making is therefore a family matter as well as a normative developmental transition. Yet, little is known about the decision-making process. This paper reviews the literature regarding informed consent, advance care planning, and proxy decision-making and outlines a theoretical model for familial decision-making. Previous models of end-of-life capacity evaluations and family assessments are presented and serve as the basis for a comprehensive assessment of familial decision-making at the end of life. Functional capacity evaluations of individuals at the end of life regarding decisions about life-sustaining medical treatments enable both the individual patient and one identified proxy from his or her family to discuss important issues families may face during medical crises at the end of life. The information gleaned from such evaluations has the potential to assist psychologists and other professionals in designing family-specific interventions to reduce caregiving distress, improve quality of life for dying patients, and ease the transition to bereavement for caregivers.']",['eng'],"['Decision Making', 'Family', 'Health Services/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Proxy/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Terminal Care/legislation & jurisprudence']",

Hearing as a warning sense relies on rapidly-conducting fibers, and on the basis of the magnocellular deficit theory, we wondered whether auditory alerting would be weakened in dyslexic adults. We quantified the strength of sound-induced spinal facilitation in seven dyslexic and eight normal-reading adults by measuring the amplitudes of H-reflex, a monosynaptic spinal reflex, after loud binaural sounds. The audiospinal facilitation was of similar strength in dyslexic and control adults, indicating normal auditory alerting via cerebrospinal pathways. The slightly prolonged facilitation in dyslexics agrees with the dyslexics' general sluggishness of sensorimotor processing.""]",['eng'],"['Acoustic Stimulation', 'Adult', 'Dyslexia/complications', 'Dyslexia/physiopathology', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Reflex', 'Sensation Disorders/etiology', 'Sensation Disorders/physiopathology', 'Spinal Cord/physiopathology', 'Tibial Nerve']",

Amblyopia was initially regarded to be enigmatic and believed to be related to eccentric fixation (W1, after 1850); later, it was ascribed to disorders in refraction or accommodation (W2, around 1900). After 1900 (W3), phylogenetic explanations appeared, and after 1945 (W4) concepts based on successful orthoptic practice came to the fore. Since 1965 (W5), research on amblyopia has been guided by modern insights into neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. In contrast to amblyopia, nystagmus has always been a well-defined symptomatic entity. Even though amblyopia and nystagmus are both symptoms of strabismus, their understanding has therefore developed along different paths. In juvenile strabismus, defects in binocularity lead to monolateral amblyopia, while defects in contour vision lead to bilateral nystagmus. In the present paper, these five waves of amblyopia research are described in more detail, with particular attention to the concepts of adaptation, visual fields, and sensory and motor functions as related to disorders in reading and accommodation.']",['eng'],"['Accommodation, Ocular', 'Adaptation, Ocular', 'Amblyopia/history', 'Dyslexia/history', 'History, 16th Century', 'History, 17th Century', 'History, 18th Century', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Ocular Motility Disorders/history', 'Ophthalmology/history', 'Research/history', 'Strabismus/history', 'Visual Fields']",

Sanchez de Jimenez, L. Medrano, and E. Martinez-Barajas [1995] Biochemistry 34: 2826-2831). Rubisco was heat-treated in both the carbamylated and uncarbamylated forms and in the presence and absence of 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Both forms were highly resistant to heat denaturation and further protection was gained in the presence of DTT. A 50% loss in total activity occurred after 1 h at 57.5 and 55.2[deg]C for uncarbamylated Rubisco and at 60.2 and 59.6[deg]C for carbamylated Rubisco, in each case with and without DTT, respectively. In contrast, Rubisco activase lost 50% activity after only 5 min at 33[deg]C and the loss in activity was not affected by the presence of Rubisco. When Rubisco, heat-denatured to various extents, was incubated at room temperature with Rubisco activase or bovine serum albumin as a control, Rubisco activase did not have a significant specific ability to restore Rubisco activity. We conclude that Rubisco activase alone does not have the ability to restore the activity of heat-denatured Rubisco and is unlikely to protect or restore Rubisco activity from heat denaturation in vivo because it is more heat-labile than Rubisco.']",['eng'],,

Rubisco regulation was assessed by measuring (a) the ratio of initial to total Rubisco activity, which reflects primarily the carbamylation state of the enzyme, and (b) total Rubisco activity per mol of Rubisco catalytic sites, which declines when 2-carboxyarabinitol 1-phosphate (CA1P) binds to carbamylated Rubisco. In all species examined, the activity ratio of Rubisco declined with a reduction in light intensity, although substantial variation was apparent between species in the degree of Rubisco deactivation. No relationship existed between the degree of Rubisco deactivation and C4 subtype. Dicots generally deactivated Rubisco to a greater degree than monocots. The total activity of Rubisco per catalytic site was generally independent of light intensity, indicating that CA1P and other inhibitors are not major contributors to the light-dependent regulation of Rubisco activity in C4 plants. The light response of the activity ratio of Rubisco was measured in detail in Amaranthus retroflexus, Brachiaria texana, and Zea mays. In A. retroflexus and B. texana, the activity ratio declined dramatically below a light intensity of 400 to 500 [mu]mol of photons m-2 s-1. In Z. mays, the activity ratio of Rubisco was relatively insensitive to light intensity compared with the other species. In A. retroflexus, the pool size of ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) declined with reduced light intensity except between 50 and 500 [mu]mol m-2 s-1, when the activity ratio of Rubisco was light dependent. In Z. mays, by contrast, the pool size of RuBP was light dependent only below 350 [mu]mol m-2 s-1. These results indicate that, in response to changes in light intensity, most C4 species regulate Rubisco by reversible carbamylation of catalytic sites, as commonly observed in C3 plants. In a few species, notably Z. mays, Rubisco is not extensively regulated in response to changes in light intensity, possibly because the activity of the CO2 pump may become limiting for photosynthesis at subsaturating light intensity.']",['eng'],,

The aim of this study was to determine the calcium balance of individuals on a vegan diet in comparison with a lactovegetarian diet in a short-term investigation. Seven women and one man, ranging in age from 19 to 24 years, received during the first 10 days a vegan diet based on plant foods and calcium-rich mineral water and a lactovegetarian diet during the following 10 days. Portion size was adapted to the subjects' individual energy requirements. Calcium status was assessed by means of calcium intake in food and calcium output in feces and urine as measured by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. In addition, deoxypyridinoline was measured in urine as a marker of bone resorption. The results show a significantly smaller daily calcium intake with an average of 843 +/- 140 mg in the vegan versus 1322 +/- 303 mg in the lactovegetarian diet. Apparent calcium absorption rates were calculated as 26% +/- 15% in the vegan and 24% +/- 8% in the lactovegetarian group (NS). The calcium balance was positive both in the vegan diet (119 +/- 113 mg/day) and in the lactovegetarian diet (211 +/- 136 mg/day) (NS). Deoxypyridinoline excretion showed no significant difference between the two diets (105 +/- 31 and 98 +/- 23 nmol/day). The present results indicate that calcium balance and a marker of bone turnover are not affected significantly when calcium is provided either solely by plant foods or by a diet including dairy products, despite the significantly different calcium intake levels in the diets.

All steroids, including progesterone, that display antagonist properties when bound to the wild-type MR are able to activate the mutant receptor (MR(L810)). These findings suggest that progesterone may contribute to the dramatic aggravation of hypertension in MR(L810) carriers during pregnancy. However, the steroid(s) responsible for hypertension in MR(L810) carriers (men and nonpregnant women) has not yet been identified. Here we show that cortisone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone, the main cortisol and corticosterone metabolites produced in the distal nephron, where sodium reabsorption stimulated by aldosterone takes place, bind with high affinity to MR(L810). The potency with which cortisone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone bind to the mutant MR contrasts sharply with their low wild-type MR-binding capacity. In addition, cotransfection assays demonstrate that cortisone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone are potent activators of the MR(L810) trans-activation function. Because the plasma concentration of cortisol in humans is about 30-fold higher than that of corticosterone, these findings strongly suggest that cortisone is one of the endogenous steroids responsible for early-onset hypertension in men and nonpregnant women carrying the MR(L810) mutation.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Aldosterone/metabolism', 'Aldosterone/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'COS Cells', 'Corticosterone/analogs & derivatives', 'Corticosterone/metabolism', 'Corticosterone/pharmacology', 'Cortisone/chemistry', 'Cortisone/metabolism', 'Cortisone/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/chemistry', 'Hydrocortisone/metabolism', 'Hydrocortisone/pharmacology', 'Hypertension/genetics', 'Hypertension/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Point Mutation', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular/physiopathology', 'Receptors, Mineralocorticoid/genetics', 'Receptors, Mineralocorticoid/metabolism']","['Receptors, Mineralocorticoid', 'Aldosterone (4964P6T9RB)', '11-dehydrocorticosterone (FO4V44A3G3)', 'Cortisone (V27W9254FZ)', 'Corticosterone (W980KJ009P)', 'Hydrocortisone (WI4X0X7BPJ)']"

Midazolam decreased QO(2) at 1.0mg/kg, whereas flumazenil had no effect. In combination with per se ineffective GABA (10(-6)mol/l), flumazenil showed respiratory depressant action, presumably revealing partial agonistic activity at some of GABA(A) receptor subtypes. However, it completely antagonized effects of midazolam on QO(2), on its own and in presence of GABA. Our results show that in vivo well-established effects of midazolam on cerebral metabolic activity could be reproduced in in vitro settings.

Despite decreased SIDS death rates following the ""Back to Sleep"" intervention in 1994, this disparity in death rates has increased. The prone sleep position, unsafe sleep surfaces, and sharing a sleep surface with others (bedsharing) increase the risk of sudden infant death. The race-specific prevalence of these modifiable risk factors in sudden unexpected infant deaths-including SIDS, accidental suffocation (AS), and cause of death undetermined (UD)-has not been investigated in a population-based study. Death rates attributable to AS and UD are also higher in African Americans (AAs) than in other races (non-AA). The potential contribution of unsafe sleep practices to this overall disparity in death rates is uncertain.!##!Objective!#!The objective of this study was to compare death rates attributable to SIDS and related causes of death (AS and UD) in AA and non-AA infants and the prevalence of unsafe sleep practices at time of death. Our hypothesis was that there is a large racial disparity in these modifiable risk factors at the time of death, and that public awareness of this could lead to improved intervention strategies to reduce the disparity in death rates.!##!Methods!#!In this population-based study, we retrospectively reviewed death-scene information and medical examiners\' investigations of deaths in St Louis City and County between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1997. The deaths of all infants <2 years old with the diagnoses of SIDS, AS, or UD were included. Sleep surfaces other than those specifically designed and approved for infant use were termed nonstandard (adult beds, sofas, etc). Denominators for our rate estimates were the number of births (AA and non-AA) in St Louis City and County during the study period.!##!Results!#!The deaths of 119 infants were studied (81 AA and 38 non-AA). SIDS rates were much higher in AA than non-AA infants (2.08 vs 0.65 per 1000 live births), as was the rate of AS (0.47 vs 0.06). There was a trend for increased deaths diagnosed as UD in AA infants (0.36 vs 0.06). Bedsharing deaths were nearly twice as common in AAs (67.1% vs 35.1% of deaths), as were deaths on nonstandard sleep surfaces (79.0% vs 46.0%). Forty-nine percent (49.1%) of all infants who died while bedsharing were found on their backs or sides compared with 20.4% of infants who were not bedsharing. Overall, the fraction of infants found in these nonprone positions was not different for AA infants and non-AA infants (43.3% vs 38.5%). In AA and non-AA infants, factors that greatly increase the risk of bedsharing, such as sofa sharing or all-night bedsharing, were present in all or many bedsharing deaths.!##!Conclusion!#!Among AA infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly, the high prevalence of nonstandard bed use and bedsharing may underlie, in part, their increased death rates. Public health messages tailored for the AA community have stressed first and foremost using nonprone sleep positions. The observation that there was no difference between AA and non-AA infants in position found at death suggests that racial disparity in sleep position is not the most important contributor to racial disparity in death rates. The finding that more infants died on their back or side while bedsharing than otherwise suggests that these sleep positions are less protective when associated with bedsharing. We conclude that public health information tailored for the AA community should give equal emphasis to risks and alternatives to bedsharing as to avoidance of the prone position.']",['eng'],"['African Americans', 'Asphyxia/epidemiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Missouri/epidemiology', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sudden Infant Death/epidemiology', 'Sudden Infant Death/ethnology']",

We describe the chromosomal complement of a novel tumorigenic prostate epithelial cell subline, called M2205, that acquired only three new, consistent chromosomal changes (from those present in the SV40T antigen immortalized parental cell line, P69SV40TAg) when it attained tumor-forming potential. The consistent changes, which were fully characterized using GTG-banding, CBG-banding, silver staining, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), and spectral karyotyping (SKY), involved segmental jumping translocations and resulted in gains in the copy number of genes located on the distal long arm of chromosome 8 (8q22 to 8q24.3), including c-myc. Furthermore, the jumping translocations also resulted in ribosomal genes being present in multiple, tandem copies next to the chromatin from 8q. Given the relatively small number of cytogenetic changes present, this subline provides a means for better understanding the cellular changes associated with the acquired chromosomal imbalances. Further studies of this subline could also provide insight as to the mechanism or mechanisms leading to the formation of jumping translocations, as well as potential position effects resulting from the relocation of ribosomal genes next to other cellular genes or oncogenes.']",['eng'],"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics', 'Epithelial Cells/pathology', 'Gene Amplification/genetics', 'Genes, myc/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",

Sixteen dyslexic and 16 control university students were administered a full battery of psychometric, phonological, auditory, visual and cerebellar tests. Individual data reveal that all 16 dyslexics suffer from a phonological deficit, 10 from an auditory deficit, four from a motor deficit and two from a visual magnocellular deficit. Results suggest that a phonological deficit can appear in the absence of any other sensory or motor disorder, and is sufficient to cause a literacy impairment, as demonstrated by five of the dyslexics. Auditory disorders, when present, aggravate the phonological deficit, hence the literacy impairment. However, auditory deficits cannot be characterized simply as rapid auditory processing problems, as would be predicted by the magnocellular theory. Nor are they restricted to speech. Contrary to the cerebellar theory, we find little support for the notion that motor impairments, when found, have a cerebellar origin or reflect an automaticity deficit. Overall, the present data support the phonological theory of dyslexia, while acknowledging the presence of additional sensory and motor disorders in certain individuals.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Articulation Disorders/complications', 'Auditory Perception', 'Brain Diseases/complications', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Dyslexia/etiology', 'Humans', 'Motion Perception', 'Phonetics', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Psychometrics', 'Speech Perception', 'Vision Disorders/complications', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Perception']",

This prodrug is a synthetic prostaglandin analogue, which in appropriate cases is administered topically for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. The isopropyl ester prodrug is rapidly hydrolyzed by esterases in the cornea to the biologically active, free acid. Travoprost has demonstrated preferential affinity and full agonist activity for the FP receptor in the nanomolar range, with no meaningful affinity or activity at other receptors. Like other compounds of this class, the reduction of intraocular pressure by travoprost is due at least in part to increased uveoscleral outflow. Results from phase II and phase III pivotal studies for FDA approval in the United States have demonstrated that travoprost is an effective topical agent for treatment of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.

Motor and facial behaviors were coded independently, using the NIDCAP and the NFCS (Neonatal Facial Coding System), respectively, and compared with heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation responses. Of the movements hypothesized to be stress cues in the NIDCAP model, extension of arms and legs (80%) and finger splay (70%) were the most common following lance. Contrary to the model, most infants (70%) had lower incidence of twitches and startles post-lance compared to baseline. Whereas all infants showed some NFCS response to lance, for three infants, the magnitude was low. HR increased and oxygen saturation decreased post-lance. Infants with more prior pain exposure, lower Apgar, and lower GA at birth, displayed more motor stress cues but less facial activity post-lance.

Families experience anxiety when leaving the security of the close monitoring seen in ICU (Leith, 1999) and their anxiety reduces their ability to play a key role in the patient's recovery (McShane, 1991; Leske, 1992) as it can impair their decision-making (Cagan, 1988; Halm et al., 1993). By reducing a family's anxiety, they may be more able to cope with the necessary transition to a general ward and support the patient's recovery.

Further articles were retrieved from citation references from the Web of Science or through the reference lists of retrieved literature. Library catalogues were searched using the same key words for books and book chapters. von Bertalanffy's General System Theory provides a framework for understanding the importance of family in a critical illness situation. Critical illness permits little or no time to adapt, thus reducing the family's ability to cope with the situation. Transfer out of ICU is a significant anxiety-producing event for families. Uncertainty in illness is reported in other illness situations to reduce family's adaptation to illness events, but has not been researched with an ICU cohort of families. Seven out of the top 10 needs of ICU families are information needs, highlighting the importance of communication regarding progress and future plans. Nurses require an increased awareness that transfer anxiety exists for families and to be knowledgeable about ways to reduce its occurrence. Research is required to evaluate the efficacy of interventions to reduce anxiety for families and examine the level of uncertainty in illness in this cohort.""]",['eng'],"['Anxiety', 'Communication', 'Critical Care/psychology', 'Critical Illness/psychology', 'Emotions', 'Family/psychology', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Patient Transfer', 'Professional-Family Relations', 'Stress, Physiological/psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Uncertainty']",

The effects of the Buteyko breathing technique, a device which mimics pranayama (a yoga breathing technique), and a dummy pranayama device on bronchial responsiveness and symptoms were compared over 6 months in a parallel group study.!##!Methods!#!Ninety patients with asthma taking an inhaled corticosteroid were randomised after a 2 week run in period to Eucapnic Buteyko breathing, use of a Pink City Lung Exerciser (PCLE) to mimic pranayama, or a PCLE placebo device. Subjects practised the techniques at home twice daily for 6 months followed by an optional steroid reduction phase. Primary outcome measures were symptom scores and change in the dose of methacholine provoking a 20% fall in FEV(1) (PD(20)) during the first 6 months.!##!Results!#!Sixty nine patients (78%) completed the study. There was no significant difference in PD(20) between the three groups at 3 or 6 months. Symptoms remained relatively stable in the PCLE and placebo groups but were reduced in the Buteyko group. Median change in symptom scores at 6 months was 0 (interquartile range -1 to 1) in the placebo group, -1 (-2 to 0.75) in the PCLE group, and -3 (-4 to 0) in the Buteyko group (p=0.003 for difference between groups). Bronchodilator use was reduced in the Buteyko group by two puffs/day at 6 months; there was no change in the other two groups (p=0.005). No difference was seen between the groups in FEV(1), exacerbations, or ability to reduce inhaled corticosteroids.!##!Conclusion!#!The Buteyko breathing technique can improve symptoms and reduce bronchodilator use but does not appear to change bronchial responsiveness or lung function in patients with asthma. No benefit was shown for the Pink City Lung Exerciser.']",['eng'],"['Adrenergic beta-Agonists/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma/therapy', 'Breathing Exercises', 'Female', 'Forced Expiratory Volume/physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Steroids/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vital Capacity/physiology']","['Adrenergic beta-Agonists', 'Steroids']"

In dyslipidemic patients, rosuvastatin produced markedly greater reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and equivalent or greater improvements in various lipid measures, including high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides when compared with atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin. In addition, rosuvastatin is more effective than these statins in allowing patients to reach National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III and Joint European Societies LDL cholesterol goals. The safety profile of rosuvastatin was reviewed (as of April 2003) in 12,569 patients, representing 14,231 patient-years of treatment at doses up to 80 mg. In controlled trials, rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg demonstrated a similar adverse event profile to those for atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg, simvastatin 10 to 80 mg, and pravastatin 10 to 40 mg. Myopathy (defined as muscle symptoms plus serum creatine kinase levels >10 times the upper limit of normal) attributed to rosuvastatin occurred in < or = 0.03% of patients receiving rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg. No cases of rhabdomyolysis occurred in patients receiving rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg. Clinically significant alanine aminotransferase elevations occurred in 0.2% of patients receiving rosuvastatin and those receiving atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin. Compared with other widely used statins, the benefit-risk profile of rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg appears to be very favorable.']",['eng'],"['Cholesterol, HDL/blood', 'Cholesterol, LDL/blood', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Fluorobenzenes/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Hyperlipidemias/drug therapy', 'Pyrimidines', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rosuvastatin Calcium', 'Safety', 'Sulfonamides']","['Cholesterol, HDL', 'Cholesterol, LDL', 'Fluorobenzenes', 'Pyrimidines', 'Sulfonamides', 'Rosuvastatin Calcium (83MVU38M7Q)']"

In the United States, more than.5 million people have a primary arthroplasty each year. Less than 10% of prosthesis recipients have complications develop during their lifetime, commonly as a result of aseptic biomechanical failure, followed by prosthetic joint infection. The pathogenesis of prosthetic joint infection is related to bacteria in biofilms, in which they are protected from antimicrobial killing and host responses rendering these infections difficult to eradicate. Current microbiology laboratory methods for diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection depend on isolation of a pathogen by culture. However, these methods have neither ideal sensitivity nor ideal specificity. Therefore, culture-independent molecular methods have been used to improve the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection. In the research setting, detection of 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction has been used in the molecular diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection. Various antibiofilm strategies directed at disruption of adherent bacteria are the focus of intense research to improve the detection of biofilm organisms and their eradication. In this article, molecular and antibiofilm approaches to prosthetic joint infection are reviewed.']",['eng'],"['Attachment Sites, Microbiological', 'Biofilms/drug effects', 'Biofilms/growth & development', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Drug Contamination', 'Humans', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prosthesis Failure', 'Prosthesis-Related Infections/diagnosis', 'Prosthesis-Related Infections/microbiology', 'Sonication', 'Ultrasonic Therapy']",

To compare the responses of these individuals with those of patients with neurocysticercosis, we screened seropositive persons among family members of 16 patients. We searched for specific antibodies in patients and their 118 households by an enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot assay using specific glycoproteins of T. solium metacestodes. We found six seropositive individuals without neurocysticercosis among members of four families. The matching patients were young, harbored viable cysts, and had short evolution of disease. The baseline response of healthy seropositive individuals was scarce and showed a low frequency of antibodies against glycoproteins GP39-42 and GP24, which are immunodominant in patients with neurocysticercosis. Moreover, they became spontaneously negative in few months. The response of patients was heterogeneous as shown in other studies. The results of this work support a highly dynamic host-parasite immunologic interaction and suggest individual susceptibility or level of exposure among family members.']",['eng'],"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Helminth/immunology', 'Brain Diseases/epidemiology', 'Brain Diseases/etiology', 'Brain Diseases/immunology', 'Child', 'Family', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/immunology', 'Male', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neurocysticercosis/epidemiology', 'Neurocysticercosis/etiology', 'Neurocysticercosis/immunology', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Taenia/immunology']","['Antigens, Helminth', 'Immunodominant Epitopes']"

The precise function of the ALDP (ALD protein) still remains unclear. Aldp deficiency in mammals and Bgm deficiency in Drosophila led to accumulation of VLCFAs (very long-chain fatty acids). As a first step towards studying this interaction in wild-type versus Aldp-deficient mice, we analysed the expression pattern of the murine orthologue of the Bgm gene. In contrast with the ubiquitously expressed Ald gene, Bgm expression is restricted to the tissues that are affected by X-ALD such as brain, testis and adrenals. During mouse brain development, Bgm mRNA was first detected by Northern-blot analysis on embryonic day 18 and increased steadily towards adulthood, whereas the highest level of Ald mRNA was found on embryonic day 12 and decreased gradually during differentiation. Protein fractionation and confocal laser imaging of Bgm-green fluorescent protein fusion proteins revealed a microsomal localization that was different from peroxisomes (where Aldp is detected), endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. Mouse Bgm showed acyl-CoA synthetase activity towards a VLCFA substrate in addition to LCFAs, and this activity was enriched in the microsomal compartment. Speculating that Bgm expression could be regulated by Ald deficiency, we compared the abundance of Bgm mRNA in wild-type and Ald knockout mice but observed no difference. Although mouse Bgm is capable of activating VLCFA, we conclude that a direct interaction between the mouse Bgm and the Aldp seems unlikely.']",['eng'],"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics', 'Animals', 'Brain/embryology', 'Brain/growth & development', 'Brain/metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Coenzyme A Ligases/analysis', 'Coenzyme A Ligases/genetics', 'Coenzyme A Ligases/metabolism', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Components', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microsomes/enzymology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Tissue Distribution']","['Drosophila Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Coenzyme A Ligases (EC 6.2.1.-)', 'lipidosin (EC 6.2.1.-)', 'FAA2 protein, S cerevisiae (EC 6.2.1.3)', 'bgm protein, Drosophila (EC 6.2.1.3)', 'long-chain-fatty-acid-CoA ligase (EC 6.2.1.3)']"

Furthermore, in contrast to other benign melanocytic proliferations, the lesional cells in EBN exhibit little or no maturation as they extend deeper into the underlying tissue.

Timing of TMS was individually adjusted based on each subject's VEP-latency. A condition of TMS without concurrent visual stimulation (TMS(alone)) served for subtraction purposes (VIS&TMS minus TMS(alone)) to partial out TMS-related contaminations of the EEG signal.!##!Results!#!When TMS was applied at visual stimulus onset, VEPs (as calculated by subtraction) perfectly matched control VEPs to visual stimulation alone. TMS at around P1, in contrast, modified the targeted (P1) and the subsequent VEP component (N1), independently of whether TMS was given at build-up or peak.!##!Conclusions!#!The retrieval of regular VEPs with concomitant TMS at visual stimulus onset suggests that the employed EEG system and subtraction procedure are suited for combined EEG-TMS studies.

M14597294,['Normal and pathological reading: converging data from lesion and imaging studies.'],"['In this paper we discuss cognitive and anatomical models of reading that have emerged from behavioral and lesion studies of dyslexia and functional neuroimaging studies of normal subjects. We then suggest that discrepancies in their findings can partly be overcome by functional neuroimaging studies of patients with acquired dyslexia. We present two such studies. One patient had a large left temporoparietal lesion which limited his reading to words with high semantic associations. When he read these words aloud, activation was observed in all areas of the normal reading system with the exception of the damaged left superior temporal lobe. The second patient had anterior temporal lobe atrophy with semantic dementia and a deficit in reading words that rely on lexical or semantic mediation. When asked to read aloud words on which she was likely to succeed, she activated all the normal areas, with increased activation in a left sensorimotor area associated with phonological processing and decreased activation in several areas associated with semantic processing. By relating these findings to those from lesion studies and imaging studies of normals, we propose that the translation of orthography to phonology is mediated semantically by the anterior part of the left midfusiform gyrus. In contrast, when semantic processing is compromised, the translation of orthography to phonology will be more reliant on the posterior part of the left midfusiform and the left frontal areas associated with phonology. Future studies are required to examine the connectivity between these areas during normal and abnormal reading.']",['eng'],"['Brain/anatomy & histology', 'Brain/physiology', 'Brain/physiopathology', 'Brain Diseases/pathology', 'Brain Mapping/methods', 'Cognition', 'Diagnostic Imaging/methods', 'Humans', 'Models, Neurological']",

ETF is the intermediate electron carrier between the dehydrogenases and ETF-QO. The steady-state kinetic constants of human ETF-QO were determined with ubiquinone homologues and analogues that contained saturated n-alkyl substituents at the 6 position. These experiments show that optimal substrates contain a ten-carbon-atom side chain, consistent with a preliminary crystal structure that shows that only the first two of ten isoprene units of co-enzyme Q10 (CoQ10) interact with the protein. Derivatives with saturated alkyl side chains are very good substrates, indicating that, unlike other ubiquinone oxidoreductases, there is little preference for the methyl branches or rigidity of the CoQ side chain. Few of the compounds that inhibit ubiquinone oxidoreductases inhibit ETF-QO. Compounds found to act as inhibitors of ETF-QO include 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide, a naphthoquinone analogue, 2-(3-methylpentyl)-4,6-dinitrophenol and pentachlorophenol. 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone (DBMIB), which inhibits the mitochondrial bc1 complex and the chloroplast b6 f complex in redox-dependent fashion, can serve as an electron acceptor for human ETF-QO. The observation of simple Michaelis-Menten kinetic patterns and a single type of quinone-binding site, determined by fluorescence titrations of the protein with DBMIB and 6-(10-bromodecyl)ubiquinone, are consistent with one ubiquinone-binding site per ETF-QO monomer.']",['eng'],"['Electron-Transferring Flavoproteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/metabolism', 'Quinones/chemistry', 'Quinones/metabolism', 'Quinones/pharmacology', 'Ubiquinone/analogs & derivatives']","['Electron-Transferring Flavoproteins', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins', 'Quinones', 'Ubiquinone (1339-63-5)', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors (EC 1.5.-)', 'electron-transferring-flavoprotein dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.5.1)']"
M14648173,['A retrospective study of unplanned out-of-hospital deliveries.'],"['Our objective was to determine maternal characteristics and perinatal outcome of unplanned unattended deliveries en route to the hospital in comparison to unplanned deliveries attended by medical personnel within the parking facility of the hospital. All singleton deliveries occurring between 1988 and 1999 were analyzed from the computerized perinatal database. Maternal characteristics and pregnancy outcome of unattended, unplanned out-of-hospital births were compared with unplanned deliveries in the hospital parking lot, with the assistance of medical personnel. Out of 2328 out-of-hospital deliveries, 5.7% ( n=133) were managed by medical personnel in the parking lot and 94.3% ( n=2195) occurred en route to the hospital. The birth weight of newborns from the attended out-of-hospital delivery group was significantly higher than the comparison group (3126.2+/-516 g vs. 3019+/-522 g; P=0.023). A significant linear association was found between birth weight and attended out-of-hospital births (Mantel-Haenszel test for linear association; P=0.002). Moreover, these newborns were significantly more likely to be large for gestational age (OR=2.2, 95% CI 1.2-3.9; P=0.004). Parturients who delivered in the parking lot with the assistance of medical personnel, had significantly higher rates of grade 2 perineal tears (OR=8.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.4; P=0.041). Perinatal mortality was non-significantly higher among attended out-of-hospital deliveries (OR=2.8, 95% CI 0.8-8.3; P=0.279) as compared to unattended out-of-hospital deliveries. The attendance of medical personnel in unplanned out-of-hospital deliveries did not influence the birth outcome.']",['eng'],"['Adult', 'Birth Weight', 'Delivery, Obstetric/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Israel/epidemiology', 'Maternal Health Services/statistics & numerical data', 'Medical Records', 'Parking Facilities/statistics & numerical data', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transportation of Patients/statistics & numerical data']",
